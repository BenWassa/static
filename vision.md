"# Vision

Static equips self-aware adults with a grounded framework for turning overwhelming sensory, social, and energy demands into actionable insight. The project turns the accumulated research into precise language, relatable scenarios, and practical scaffolds so readers can map their experiences without needing a clinical translation.

## Guiding Beliefs

- People are already experts on their own bodies and minds; Static provides structured mirrors and vocabulary.
- Accuracy about neurology and energy dynamics matters, but language should stay clear and whole-body.
- Every insight earns its keep through an example, a strategy, or a question that invites agency.

## Deliverables

- A research compendium that distills neurobiological systems, masking, capacity, and evidence-based tactics.
- A manuscript that moves from mechanical literacy to pattern recognition to strategy playbooks.
- A living synthesis process that converts each research finding into manuscript building blocks and practice guides.

## Stretch Goals

- Visual diagrams and tables in `assets/diagrams/` to surface key models.
- A companion workbook for readers to track their own sensory, energy, and social patterns.
