# Behavior: Auditory Hypersensitivity

## Observable Pattern  
Individuals may experience background noises, such as the hum of fluorescent lights or traffic, as intensely distracting or physically painful [1][2]. This often results in a difficulty tuning out background noise and rapid fatigue in multi-sensory environments [3].

## Common Scenarios  
- Inability to concentrate in open-plan offices due to ambient chatter [1].  
- Physical pain or distress caused by sudden loud noises (sirens, alarms) [4].  
- Exhaustion after spending time in environments with layered noise (e.g., restaurants) [5].

## Neurological Mechanism  
The brain fails to habituate to repetitive sounds, leading to a state of chronic autonomic arousal [6]. This is linked to altered thalamocortical "gating," where the thalamus fails to filter redundant sensory input before it reaches the cortex, potentially due to reduced GABAergic inhibitory tone [7][8].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Thalamus (Thalamocortical gating) [7]  
- Auditory Cortex [9]  
- GABAergic system (Inhibitory tone) [8]

## Variability Notes  
Variability exists in the specific physiological response; some individuals show latency alterations in early evoked responses (e.g., N100 gating deficits) which correlate with sensory sensitivity [10].

behavior-02-visual-overwhelm.md  
# Behavior: Visual Overwhelm

## Observable Pattern  
Exposure to bright lights, sub-visible flicker (like fluorescent lighting), or visual clutter causes significant discomfort or distress [11]. This often leads to difficulties disengaging attention from visual stimuli and can trigger cognitive overload [4].

## Common Scenarios  
- Headaches or fatigue from working under fluorescent lights [11].  
- Distress caused by cluttered environments or complex visual patterns [4].  
- Sensitivity to warm vs. cool LED lighting temperatures [11].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Visual stress is linked to high salience and attentional capture, where the brain struggles to disengage from high-intensity stimuli [4]. Predictive processing models suggest an inability to minimize prediction error regarding sensory input, keeping the system in a state of high alert [12][13].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Visual Cortex [14]  
- Salience Network (Insula/ACC) [15]  
- LC-NE (Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine) system [12]

## Variability Notes  
Autistic adults report significantly higher levels of discomfort with artificial lighting compared to control groups, but specific triggers (flicker vs. brightness) vary by individual [11].

behavior-03-tactile-defensiveness.md  
# Behavior: Tactile Defensiveness

## Observable Pattern  
Aversive reactions to unexpected touch, specific textures (e.g., clothing tags, food textures), or light touch, which are perceived as threats or pain [16][17]. This can manifest as pulling away, agitation, or needing to remove specific clothing immediately.

## Common Scenarios  
- Intense irritation from clothing labels or tight fabrics [17].  
- "Pushing away" or agitation when touched unexpectedly [16].  
- Distress during grooming activities like hair cutting or brushing.

## Neurological Mechanism  
This is a bottom-up processing difference where the central nervous system perceives everyday tactile inputs with higher intensity or a lower threshold, treating them as threats [17]. It involves increased skin conductance responses (SCR) to mildly aversive stimuli, indicating elevated defensive arousal [18].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Somatosensory Cortex  
- Sympathetic Nervous System (SAM axis) [19]  
- Amygdala (Threat detection) [20]

## Variability Notes  
While some individuals are hyper-reactive (defensive), others may be hypo-reactive or seek deep pressure to regulate [6].

behavior-04-sensory-seeking.md  
# Behavior: Sensory Seeking Behaviors

## Observable Pattern  
Active engagement in behaviors that provide intense sensory input, such as rocking, pacing, or using deep pressure [6][2]. These behaviors often serve to calm an over-responsive nervous system or alert a hypo-responsive one [2].

## Common Scenarios  
- Pacing or bouncing on a gym ball to maintain focus [2].  
- Seeking "heavy work" like pushing or carrying weighted objects [21].  
- Chewing on objects or seeking crunchy foods (oral-motor input) [1].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Proprioceptive input (deep pressure) activates the parasympathetic nervous system, counteracting "fight or flight" responses and releasing neurotransmitters that promote relaxation [21]. It helps ground the individual by providing predictable rhythmic input [2].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Parasympathetic Nervous System [21]  
- Proprioceptive System (Muscles/Joints) [21]  
- Vestibular System (Balance/Movement) [2]

## Variability Notes  
Individuals may switch between sensory seeking and sensory avoiding depending on their current state of arousal (hypo- vs. hyper-arousal) [6][2].

behavior-05-difficulty-filtering-background-noise.md  
# Behavior: Difficulty Filtering Background Noise

## Observable Pattern  
A struggle to prioritize relevant auditory information over irrelevant background sounds, leading to "flooding" where all sounds compete for attention simultaneously [22]. This often makes conversation in crowded rooms impossible.

## Common Scenarios  
- Inability to hear a speaker in a restaurant due to clinking cutlery or background music.  
- Extreme fatigue after spending time in a busy office environment [3].  
- Needing subtitles on TV because audio mixing is too complex.

## Neurological Mechanism  
This reflects a failure in top-down thalamocortical inhibitory regulation, making it difficult to "turn down" the gain on irrelevant input [7][8]. It is also described as a failure in the brain's "gating" mechanisms, where the brain cannot filter out the background [22].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Thalamus (Thalamic Reticular Nucleus) [7]  
- Prefrontal Cortex (Top-down control) [8]  
- Auditory Cortex [9]

## Variability Notes  
This can manifest as a "processing bottleneck," where the effort to filter consumes limited working memory resources, leading to cognitive fatigue [23].

#### Social

behavior-06-eye-contact-difficulty.md  
# Behavior: Eye Contact Difficulty

## Observable Pattern  
Avoidance of direct eye gaze, or using quick "checking" glances instead of sustained fixation [24]. This is often done to reduce the intensity of social input and manage cognitive load.

## Common Scenarios  
- Looking at a person's mouth or forehead instead of their eyes.  
- Finding it easier to listen and process speech when looking away [24].  
- Forcing eye contact during "masking," resulting in exhaustion [25].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Amygdala habituation to faces is diminished (slower reduction of response over time), meaning sustained eye contact can feel like a persistent "alarm" or threat signal [26]. Additionally, face processing networks show reduced repetition suppression, meaning faces remain "non-automatic" and effortful to process [27].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Amygdala (Salience/Threat) [26]  
- Fusiform Face Area [14]  
- Superior Temporal Sulcus [14]

## Variability Notes  
Some individuals may stare intensely (over-compensating) while others avoid gaze entirely; masking can hide the underlying difficulty but increases physiological cost [25].

behavior-07-literal-interpretation.md  
# Behavior: Literal Interpretation / Missing Sarcasm

## Observable Pattern  
A tendency to interpret language precisely as spoken, often missing implied meanings, sarcasm, or metaphors [28]. This can lead to confusion in casual conversation where "reading between the lines" is expected.

## Common Scenarios  
- Answering "Can you pass the salt?" with "Yes" (without passing it).  
- Confusion when someone says "I'm fine" but their tone implies otherwise.  
- Difficulty with pragmatic language, such as turn-taking or understanding idioms [28].

## Neurological Mechanism  
This is linked to differences in "central coherence" or global processing, where the brain focuses on details (the specific words) rather than the context [17]. Neural networks for social inference (mentalizing) may show altered recruitment or connectivity [29].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Default Mode Network (Mentalizing) [29]  
- Right Temporo-Parietal Junction (rTPJ) [30]  
- Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (Language processing)

## Variability Notes  
This trait varies significantly with age and camouflaging effort; older adults may show lower pragmatic language scores [31]. High-masking adults may compensate using logic to decode sarcasm [32].

# Behavior: Missing Implicit Social Rules

## Observable Pattern  
Difficulty intuitively grasping unwritten social norms, requiring them to be learned explicitly as "rules" or algorithms [33][24]. This often results in unintentional social friction or feelings of being "out of sync."

## Common Scenarios  
- Standing too close or too far from others (proxemics).  
- Interrupting conversations due to not sensing the "pause."  
- Over-sharing personal information in professional settings.

## Neurological Mechanism  
The "Double Empathy Problem" suggests this is a mutual misunderstanding rather than a deficit [34]. Neurologically, it involves the reliance on explicit, rule-based reasoning (executive control) to navigate social situations that neurotypical brains process automatically [35].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Prefrontal Cortex (Executive Control) [35]  
- Default Mode Network (Social processing) [36]  
- Salience Network [36]

## Variability Notes  
High-masking adults may use "compensation" strategies, such as observation and script-learning, to mimic adherence to these rules, often at high cognitive cost [37].

behavior-09-face-blindness-prosopagnosia.md  
# Behavior: Face Blindness (Prosopagnosia)

## Observable Pattern  
Difficulty recognizing faces or remembering people out of context, often requiring reliance on other cues like hair, voice, or gait to identify others [24].

## Common Scenarios  
- Failing to recognize a close colleague when seeing them at the grocery store.  
- Difficulty following movie plots because characters look similar.  
- Waiting for someone to speak before recognizing them.

## Neurological Mechanism  
This is linked to atypical temporal dynamics and selective plasticity differences in the face-processing network. Specifically, there is a selective reduction in repetition suppression for faces, meaning the brain does not "learn" or habituate to faces as efficiently as it does to objects [38][27].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Fusiform Face Area [14]  
- Occipital Face Area [14]  
- Superior Temporal Sulcus [14]

## Variability Notes  
This can range from mild difficulty with acquaintances to severe inability to recognize family members. It is distinct from poor memory; it is specific to facial identity [27].

# Behavior: Delayed Social Processing

## Observable Pattern  
A lag in processing verbal information, facial expressions, and tone of voice during social interactions [33]. This often leads to "processing pauses" or realizing the meaning of a conversation hours or days later.

## Common Scenarios  
- Needing extra time to formulate a response in conversation.  
- "Freezing" during rapid-fire social exchanges.  
- Realizing someone was being rude only after the interaction has ended.

## Neurological Mechanism  
Social interaction requires simultaneous processing of multiple streams of information, which can lead to "monotropic split" and overload [33]. The autistic brain may show slower orienting and reduced habituation, maintaining high vigilance that consumes processing speed [39].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Prefrontal Cortex (Processing speed bottleneck) [40]  
- Frontoparietal Control Network [39]  
- Working Memory [41]

## Variability Notes  
Processing speed is often a "rate-limiting" constraint; even if accuracy is high, the time required to switch tasks and process input creates a lag [40][42].

#### Executive Function

behavior-11-task-initiation-paralysis.md  
# Behavior: Task Initiation Paralysis

## Observable Pattern  
The inability to start a task despite a conscious desire to do so, often described as "autistic inertia" [43]. It differs from procrastination; the individual may be physically stuck or frozen.

## Common Scenarios  
- Sitting for hours knowing you need to drink water but unable to get up.  
- Inability to switch from a high-interest task to a necessary daily chore [43].  
- "Stuck" in a transition between activities.

## Neurological Mechanism  
This is linked to the high "transition cost" required to shift focus between monotropic (deep focus) states [43]. It may also involve altered initiation mechanisms in the frontostriatal loops, distinct from inhibition deficits [44].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Frontostriatal loops [44]  
- Anterior Cingulate Cortex (Conflict monitoring) [15]  
- Dopaminergic pathways (Motivation/Movement) [45]

## Variability Notes  
Distinguished from ADHD paralysis (dopamine/interest-based) by the "transition cost" and need for predictability rather than novelty [43].

# Behavior: Difficulty with Transitions

## Observable Pattern  
Significant distress or resistance when switching between tasks, environments, or mental states [43]. This includes shifting from sleep to wakefulness, or from home to work.

## Common Scenarios  
- Meltdowns occurring when a planned activity is changed abruptly [46].  
- Needing extensive "buffer time" to recover after arriving at a new location.  
- Distress when interrupted during a focused activity [43].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Switching tasks imposes a "context switching load" that requires updating task sets, sensory remapping, and emotional recalibration [47]. The autistic brain, tending toward monotropism, experiences high neural demand when recalibrating focus, leading to "monotropic split" [43].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Prefrontal Cortex (Set shifting) [41]  
- Basal Ganglia (Switching loops) [39]  
- Locus Coeruleus (Arousal regulation) [12]

## Variability Notes  
Predictability improves performance but widens the response time gap; deviations from routine become disproportionately destabilizing [48].

# Behavior: Time Blindness

## Observable Pattern  
Difficulty perceiving the passage of time or estimating how long tasks will take [49]. This often leads to lateness or losing hours to a specific interest without realizing it.

## Common Scenarios  
- Believing a task will take 5 minutes when it takes 30.  
- Being surprised that an entire day has passed while focusing on a hobby.  
- Difficulty planning for future events due to a lack of temporal sense.

## Neurological Mechanism  
This is associated with executive dysfunction, specifically deficits in working memory and the cognitive processes required for goal-directed behavior [49]. It acts as a cognitive control constraint under uncertainty [50].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Prefrontal Cortex (Executive Function) [49]  
- Cerebellum (Timing/Sequencing) [39]  
- Working Memory [51]

## Variability Notes  
Visual timers act as an external "prosthetic" for this sense, reducing the cognitive load of tracking time internally [52].

behavior-14-decision-fatigue.md  
# Behavior: Decision Fatigue

## Observable Pattern  
A state of exhaustion and inability to make choices, triggered by the cumulative cognitive load of processing options [53]. It can lead to "choice paralysis."

## Common Scenarios  
- Inability to choose what to eat for dinner, leading to not eating.  
- Overwhelmed by shopping due to the number of product options.  
- "Shutting down" when asked simple questions after a long day.

## Neurological Mechanism  
The prefrontal cortex becomes functionally "offline" due to resource depletion [54]. High levels of uncertainty and the need for explicit processing (rather than automatic) consume limited working memory capacity [38].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Prefrontal Cortex [54]  
- Working Memory [55]  
- Anterior Cingulate Cortex (Conflict resolution) [15]

## Variability Notes  
Often exacerbated by masking, which requires constant micro-decisions about social performance [56].

# Behavior: Hyperfocus

## Observable Pattern  
An intense, narrow state of concentration on a specific topic or task ("attention tunnels") where the individual loses awareness of their surroundings and bodily needs [43].

## Common Scenarios  
- Forgetting to eat, drink, or use the bathroom for hours while working.  
- Getting annoyed when interrupted because it breaks the "flow."  
- Becoming an expert in a niche subject due to deep, sustained engagement [43].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Described by the theory of "Monotropism," where mental resources are concentrated on a limited number of high-interest channels [43]. This flow state relies on intense focus to function, and interrupting it causes distress [43].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Top-down Attentional Control [43]  
- Dopaminergic pathways (Interest-based) [57]  
- Salience Network [15]

## Variability Notes  
While often seen as a deficit (difficulty switching), it can be a significant asset ("flow state") when directed toward productive interests [43].

#### Emotional

behavior-16-alexithymia.md  
# Behavior: Alexithymia

## Observable Pattern  
Difficulty identifying and describing one's own emotions, often confusing emotions with physiological states (e.g., confusing anxiety with excitement or hunger) [58][59].

## Common Scenarios  
- Feeling "bad" or "weird" but unable to say if it is sadness, anger, or sickness.  
- A physical sensation (racing heart) is noticed before the emotion (fear) [60].  
- Difficulty answering "How are you feeling?" beyond surface-level responses.

## Neurological Mechanism  
This involves a "decoupling" between physiological arousal and conscious awareness, potentially due to altered connectivity between the insula (interoceptive center) and the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) [61][62][63].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Insula (Interoception) [63]  
- Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) [62]  
- Prefrontal Cortex (Emotion regulation) [64]

## Variability Notes  
It is a strong transdiagnostic predictor of emotion dysregulation; improvement in alexithymia is a primary mediator of therapy effectiveness [65].

# Behavior: Delayed Emotional Realization

## Observable Pattern  
The experience of not feeling an emotion until hours or days after the triggering event. This is linked to "emotional confusion" or a delay in processing interoceptive signals [61].

## Common Scenarios  
- Remaining calm during a crisis, then breaking down two days later.  
- Realizing you were angry about a comment only after replaying the conversation at night.  
- An "explosion" of emotion without immediate warning because the buildup was not felt [62].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Caused by atypical connectivity between interoceptive networks (insula) and cognitive processing centers [62]. The brain fails to integrate visceral sensations (like heart rate) into a cohesive emotional picture until the signal reaches a critical threshold [60].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Insula [62]  
- Anterior Cingulate Cortex [62]  
- Interoceptive Pathways [61]

## Variability Notes  
This delay contributes to the perception of "unpredictable" meltdowns, as the individual was unaware of the physiological ramp-up [62].

behavior-18-emotional-flooding.md  
# Behavior: Emotional Flooding Without Known Trigger

## Observable Pattern  
A sudden, overwhelming wave of emotion that shuts off logical thinking, often described as "0 to 100" in seconds [66]. This can occur seemingly without a clear external cause due to internal buildup.

## Common Scenarios  
- Sudden crying spells or rage over a minor inconvenience (e.g., dropped keys).  
- Inability to speak or think clearly during the emotional surge.  
- Physical sensations of heat, pressure, or suffocation [66].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Dysregulation of the HPA axis (stress response) and a "hijacked" amygdala lead to excessive cortisol and adrenaline release [66]. The prefrontal cortex (logic) is inhibited by the intensity of the limbic response [66].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Amygdala [66]  
- HPA Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) [66]  
- Sympathetic Nervous System [66]

## Variability Notes  
In ADHD/Autism overlap, this may be related to "Emotional Impulsivity" where the "brakes" between feeling and reaction are weak [67].

# Behavior: Meltdowns

## Observable Pattern  
An involuntary loss of behavioral control manifested as outward explosions of emotion (shouting, crying, aggression) or intense agitation [68][69]. It is typically a response to cumulative overload, not a "tantrum" aimed at getting a result [70].

## Common Scenarios  
- Uncontrollable crying or screaming after a day of sensory overload.  
- Self-injurious behavior (head-hitting) to block out pain or input [71].  
- Verbal outbursts triggered by a change in routine [46].

## Neurological Mechanism  
A "mobilization" response of the sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight) where the individual exceeds their window of tolerance [72][46]. Physiologically characterized by increased heart rate, pupil dilation, and sympathetic arousal [71].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Sympathetic Nervous System (Mobilization) [71]  
- Amygdala [73]  
- HPA Axis (Cumulative load) [19]

## Variability Notes  
Differs from "tantrums" as it is driven by overwhelm and loss of control rather than goal-directed behavior [69].

# Behavior: Shutdowns

## Observable Pattern  
An internal state of overwhelm characterized by withdrawal, reduced responsiveness, mutism (inability to speak), and immobility [68][69]. The person may appear "zoned out" or physically collapse.

## Common Scenarios  
- Going non-verbal after a stressful social interaction [69].  
- Curling into a fetal position and becoming unresponsive to touch [70].  
- "Brain fog" where thinking becomes slow or impossible [70].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Hypothesized to map onto the "freeze" or "collapse" responses in the defense cascade [72]. It involves a mix of sympathetic (muscle tone/alertness) and parasympathetic (heart rate deceleration) activation, or in severe cases, vasovagal collapse [73][74].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Parasympathetic Nervous System (Vagal brake) [73]  
- Dorsal Vagal Complex (Immobility/Collapse) [75]  
- Brainstem [76]

## Variability Notes  
Can be confused with dissociation or catatonia; typically triggered by sensory/cognitive overload rather than trauma alone [77][78].

#### Other

behavior-21-stimming.md  
# Behavior: Stimming (Self-Stimulatory Behavior)

## Observable Pattern  
Repetitive body movements (hand flapping, rocking) or manipulation of objects [6]. These behaviors provide predictable sensory input and are used for regulation.

## Common Scenarios  
- Rocking back and forth while sitting to calm down.  
- Flapping hands when excited or anxious.  
- Repetitive tapping or clicking of a pen [6].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Stimming serves as a regulatory mechanism; linear vestibular input (rocking) can calm an over-responsive nervous system [2]. It provides "just right" arousal levels and can block out unpredictable environmental stimuli [79].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Vestibular System (Linear movement) [2]  
- Proprioceptive System [21]  
- Basal Ganglia (Motor loops) [80]

## Variability Notes  
Suppression of stimming (masking) consumes cognitive resources and increases stress load [3].

# Behavior: Need for Sameness / Routine

## Observable Pattern  
A strong preference for predictable environments, routines, and rituals. Deviations from these routines cause significant distress [80].

## Common Scenarios  
- Eating the same food for breakfast every day.  
- Taking the exact same route to work; becoming distressed if a detour is required.  
- Distress when objects on a desk are moved.

## Neurological Mechanism  
Predictive processing accounts suggest that autistic brains weigh prediction errors highly; routines minimize the "volatility" of the environment, reducing the cognitive cost of constant updating [81]. It is a way to manage uncertainty [82].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Hippocampus (Contextual memory)  
- Frontostriatal loops (Rigidity) [41]  
- Predictive Coding Networks [81]

## Variability Notes  
This can manifest as "insistence on sameness" which is a distinct factor from repetitive motor movements in adult trait structures [80].

# Behavior: Intense Narrow Interests

## Observable Pattern  
Deep, highly focused engagement with specific topics or objects ("Special Interests"). This goes beyond a hobby; it is an absorbing passion that organizes the individual's world [43].

## Common Scenarios  
- Spending hours researching a specific historical event or mechanical system.  
- Steering every conversation back to the topic of interest.  
- Experiencing great joy and energy ("flow") when engaging with the interest [43].

## Neurological Mechanism  
Explained by "Monotropism," where attention is pulled into "attention tunnels" of high interest [43]. This interest-based focus provides a sense of predictability and safety [46].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Dopaminergic Reward System [57]  
- Salience Network (Attentional capture) [36]  
- Prefrontal Cortex [43]

## Variability Notes  
These interests are often a source of recovery and energy regulation ("deposits" in the energy bank) rather than just a symptom [83].

# Behavior: Masking / Camouflaging

## Observable Pattern  
The conscious or unconscious suppression of autistic traits (suppression) and the performance of neurotypical behaviors (compensation/assimilation) to fit in [84].

## Common Scenarios  
- Forcing eye contact despite discomfort [25].  
- Scripting conversations before they happen [37].  
- Suppressing stimming (e.g., sitting on hands) to appear calm [25].

## Neurological Mechanism  
A top-down, resource-intensive control process recruiting executive functions (inhibition, self-monitoring) and working memory [35]. In autistic women, this correlates with heightened ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) activity, indicating high effort in self-representation [30][85].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Prefrontal Cortex (Executive Control) [35]  
- Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (Self-monitoring) [30]  
- Hypothalamic-Limbic pathways [86]

## Variability Notes  
Sustained masking leads to exhaustion ("burnout") and is linked to higher hair cortisol levels (chronic stress) [87][88].

# Behavior: Echolalia / Scripted Language

## Observable Pattern  
Repeating words, phrases, or entire dialogue blocks from movies or conversations. This can be immediate (echoing a question) or delayed (using movie quotes in conversation) [37].

## Common Scenarios  
- Answering a question by repeating the question back.  
- Using "scripts" (pre-memorized phrases) to navigate social small talk [37].  
- Repeating a soothing phrase or noise for comfort (stimming).

## Neurological Mechanism  
Often serves as a compensatory strategy to bridge social communication difficulties, reducing the cognitive load of generating novel speech [89]. It allows participation in social interaction using "borrowed" language when spontaneous generation is too costly [37].

## Key Systems Involved  
- Working Memory (Holding scripts) [56]  
- Broca’s Area (Speech production)  
- Language Processing Networks

## Variability Notes  
High-masking adults may use sophisticated "compensation" scripts that are difficult to distinguish from spontaneous speech but require high working memory [37][56].
