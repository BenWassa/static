# Differential: Autism vs ADHD

## Overlapping Presentations  
Both conditions share executive dysfunction (task paralysis), emotional dysregulation (meltdowns/impulsivity), and sensory processing differences. Socially, both may withdraw, though for different reasons (rejection sensitivity vs. burnout).

## Distinct Mechanisms  
### In Autism:  
**Monotropism and Transition Costs.** The autistic brain focuses deeply on a limited number of "attention tunnels" (Monotropism) [1]. Executive dysfunction often stems from the high "transition cost" required to shift focus between these states, causing "monotropic split" and inertia [1]. Emotional dysregulation is often a response to rigidity or sensory/cognitive overload [2].

### In ADHD:  
**Interest-Based Nervous System.** ADHD is characterized by a deficit in attentional regulation due to decreased frontal cortex activation and weaker PFC-amygdala connectivity [3]. The brain acts as an "interest-based nervous system" requiring dopamine/novelty to initiate tasks [3]. Dysregulation is often "emotional impulsivity" due to a failure of top-down inhibition [4].

## Key Differentiators  
- **Task Paralysis:** ADHD paralysis is often driven by a lack of interest/stimulation or "choice paralysis" [5]. Autistic paralysis is driven by the difficulty of switching from a flow state or the need for predictability/sequencing [1].  
- **Social Withdrawal:** ADHD withdrawal is frequently driven by Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)—a sudden, intense pain from perceived criticism [6]. Autistic withdrawal is often a recovery need from masking or sensory overload (burnout) [7].  
- **Routine:** Autistic individuals typically rely on routine for nervous system regulation [2]; ADHD individuals often struggle to maintain routines due to a need for novelty [3].

## Why This Matters  
Interventions differ: ADHD requires stimulation and dopamine support (interest-based structure, medication) [8]. Autism requires lowering transition costs, increasing predictability, and reducing sensory load [8].

## Can Co-occur  
Yes. They are both neurodevelopmental and share genetic liability [9]. When co-occurring, the "need for sameness" (Autism) can conflict with the "need for novelty" (ADHD), creating a complex internal tension.

# Differential: Autism vs Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)

## Overlapping Presentations  
Both involve social withdrawal, avoidance of social interactions, and distress in group settings.

## Distinct Mechanisms  
### In Autism:  
**Processing Load and Masking.** Social interaction involves high "extraneous load" (sensory, cognitive, and monitoring demands) that consumes limited working memory [10]. Withdrawal is often a protective response to "monotropic split" or masking exhaustion ("autistic burnout") [7].

### In Social Anxiety:  
**Evaluative Threat.** The mechanism is rooted in the fear of negative evaluation and judgment [11]. Neural activity shows amygdala hyperactivity related to fear conditioning [12]. Dysregulation is driven by a cycle of worry and anticipatory stress [13].

## Key Differentiators  
- **Driver of Avoidance:** SAD avoidance is driven by the fear of embarrassment or scrutiny [11]. Autistic avoidance is often driven by the cognitive exhaustion of "calculating" social rules or sensory overload [7], [14].  
- **Timing of Distress:** SAD distress is often proactive/anticipatory [11]. Autistic distress may manifest as post-event exhaustion (burnout) or confusion due to missing implicit cues [6].  
- **Nature of Deficit:** SAD involves intact social instinct but blocked performance due to anxiety. Autism involves a fundamental difference in intuitive social processing (Double Empathy Problem) requiring manual compensation [15], [7].

## Why This Matters  
SAD responds to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to challenge fearful thoughts [16]. Autistic social struggles are often sensory or processing-based; standard CBT may be ineffective or invalidate the real effort required to mask [17].

## Can Co-occur  
Yes. Up to 84% of autistic adults suffer from comorbid anxiety [18].

# Differential: Autism vs PTSD/CPTSD

## Overlapping Presentations  
Hypervigilance, sensory sensitivity, shutdown/dissociation, and executive dysfunction (e.g., "functional freeze").

## Distinct Mechanisms  
### In Autism:  
**Neurodevelopmental Processing.** Differences are "hard-wired" and lifelong, involving bottom-up sensory hypersensitivity [19], [20]. Shutdowns are a physiological response to sensory/cognitive capacity being exceeded [21].

### In PTSD/CPTSD:  
**Adaptational Stress Response.** Mechanisms are adaptational responses to trauma, leading to HPA axis dysregulation and a persistent state of hyperarousal [19], [22]. Hypervigilance is a learned scanning for threat [23].

## Key Differentiators  
- **Shutdown vs. Dissociation:** Autistic shutdown involves withdrawal to regain balance from overload; the person is usually physically grounded but unresponsive [21]. PTSD dissociation involves detaching from reality/body to escape emotional pain, often with memory gaps ("lost time") [21].  
- **Sensory Triggers:** Autistic overwhelm is caused by the intensity of the input itself (e.g., loud noise) [20]. PTSD overwhelm is triggered by stimuli that act as cues/reminders of past trauma [24].  
- **Social Withdrawal:** In Autism, it is recovery from processing load [7]. In CPTSD, it is driven by mistrust and fear of interpersonal harm [25].

## Why This Matters  
Treating autistic shutdown with trauma "grounding" techniques (which demand cognitive engagement) may backfire; autistic recovery requires solitude and sensory reduction [21], [8]. Trauma requires regulating the fear response and building safety [16].

## Can Co-occur  
Yes. 32% to 45% of autistic adults experience PTSD [18]. Autistic individuals are at higher risk for trauma due to social victimization and sensory adversity.

# Differential: Autism vs Sensory Processing Differences (Transdiagnostic)

## Overlapping Presentations  
Sensory over-responsivity (SOR), meltdowns triggered by environment, avoidance of specific textures/sounds.

## Distinct Mechanisms  
### In Autism:  
**Multimodal Integration.** Sensory features are mechanistically linked to core thalamocortical gating alterations and inhibitory tone deficits [27]. These are coupled with social-communication differences and repetitive behaviors [28]. The "monotropic" mind may hyper-focus on specific sensory channels [14].

### In Sensory Processing (Transdiagnostic):  
**Isolated or Anxiety-Driven.** Sensory over-responsivity is largely transdiagnostic and appears in Anxiety, ADHD, and standalone profiles [29]. In anxiety-driven sensory issues, the threshold is lowered by worry/threat priming rather than inherent gating failure [30], [31].

## Key Differentiators  
- **Context:** In Autism, sensory features are part of a fractionated trait profile that includes social and rigidity factors [32], [28].  
- **Mechanism:** Autistic sensory issues are bottom-up (inherent sensitivity) [20]. In conditions like ADHD/Anxiety, sensory overload can be a failure of top-down filtering due to cognitive load or threat detection [30].

## Why This Matters  
Sensory regulation is a valid target regardless of diagnosis. However, in autism, sensory loading directly impacts social and executive capacity (the "load capacity" model) [33], [34].

## Can Co-occur  
Sensory processing differences are "nearly ubiquitous" in autism (95%) [35].

# Differential: Autism vs Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP)

## Overlapping Presentations  
Subclinical traits such as aloofness, pragmatic language difficulties, rigidity, and sensory sensitivities. Common in relatives of autistic individuals.

## Distinct Mechanisms  
### In Autism:  
**Clinical Threshold.** Traits are present at an intensity and frequency that cause clinically significant impairment in functioning, usually requiring support or accommodation [36].

### In BAP:  
**Genetic Liability.** BAP represents the phenotypic expression of genetic liability (polygenic risk) for autism [37]. It reflects a "subthreshold" constellation of traits that are qualitatively similar to autism but may not meet full diagnostic criteria [37].

## Key Differentiators  
- **Functional Impact:** While BAP traits can impact employment and relationships, they typically allow for higher adaptive functioning without the same level of disability seen in diagnosed autism [38].  
- **Prevalence:** BAP features are significantly higher in parents of autistic children (14-23%) compared to control parents (5-9%) [39].  
- **Measurement:** BAP is measured via tools like the BAPQ (Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire), capturing aloof personality, rigid personality, and pragmatic language [37].

## Why This Matters  
Recognizing BAP helps in understanding familial aggregation and genetic risk [37]. It validates the struggles of family members who may not qualify for a diagnosis but still experience social or rigid traits that affect their quality of life [38].

## Can Co-occur  
N/A (BAP is essentially a sub-threshold version of the same spectrum).
