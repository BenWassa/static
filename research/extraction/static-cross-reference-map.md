---

## CLUSTER 3: EXECUTIVE FUNCTION

### B11 · Task Initiation Paralysis
**Core Mechanisms:**

- Dopaminergic pathways: motivation/movement initiation differences
- Anterior Cingulate Cortex: conflict monitoring between desire to act and inability

**Related Mechanisms:**

- Interest anchoring (connecting task to motivation system)
- External cues (timer, alarm as initiation trigger)

**Related Behaviors:**

---

### B12 · Difficulty with Transitions
**Core Mechanisms:**
- Monotropic split: recalibrating from deep focus state is neurally expensive
- Context switching load: requires updating task sets, sensory remapping, emotional recalibration
- Prefrontal Cortex set-shifting deficits

---

### B14 · Decision Fatigue
**Core Mechanisms:**
- Prefrontal cortex resource depletion: becomes functionally offline under high cognitive load
- Working memory saturation: explicit processing of choices consumes limited capacity
- High uncertainty load: every decision requires explicit evaluation (no automatic shortcuts)
- ACC conflict resolution: constant low-level conflict monitoring depletes resources

**Related Mechanisms:**
- Masking (micro-decisions compound depletion)
- Cognitive load and bandwidth
- Sensory filtering (sensory load depletes same resource pool)

**Strategies:**
- Limiting choices (pre-made menus, capsule wardrobe, default options)
- Routine development (removes decisions from daily life)

**Strategies:**
- Interoception training (body scanning, noticing physical sensations)
- Emotion wheel / feeling vocabulary building
- Journaling (external processing replaces internal awareness)
- Reverse-engineering: "What happened? What does my body feel?" → emotion label
- Physical state checklist (am I hungry, tired, in pain, overstimulated?)

**Related Behaviors:**
- B17 (Delayed emotional realization) — alexithymia causes delay
- B19 (Meltdowns) — undetected emotional buildup → sudden overload

- Prefrontal cortex offline: rational/verbal capacity suppressed by intensity

**Related Mechanisms:**
- Allostatic load (accumulated stress sensitizes response)
- Autonomic dysregulation
- Alexithymia (B16) — trigger unrecognized because emotion wasn't tracked

**Strategies:**
- Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) tools — distress tolerance
- Grounding techniques (sensory anchoring — 5 senses, cold water, physical movement)
- Window of tolerance expansion (gradual nervous system training)
- Prophylactic: reduce allostatic load to prevent sensitization

**Related Behaviors:**

- Borderline personality (pattern vs. episode-based)

---

### B19 · Meltdowns
**Core Mechanisms:**
- Sympathetic nervous system mobilization: exceeds window of tolerance

---

### B20 · Shutdowns
**Core Mechanisms:**
- Freeze/collapse response: parasympathetic dorsal vagal complex activation
- Mixed sympathetic/parasympathetic: alertness + heart rate deceleration

- Allostatic load
- Autonomic dysregulation

**Strategies:**
- Quiet, safe, low-stimulation space
- No demands, no conversation
- AAC/written communication if some function remains
- Physical warmth (blanket, warm drink) — parasympathetic support

---

### B22 · Need for Sameness / Routine
**Core Mechanisms:**

## DIFFERENTIAL RISK MAP

*Where readers most likely to misattribute*

| Behavior Cluster | Risk Differential | Key Distinguisher |
|---|---|---|
| Social withdrawal | Social Anxiety | Overload vs. fear of judgment |
| Executive dysfunction | ADHD | Transition cost vs. interest/novelty |
| Hypervigilance / shutdown | PTSD/CPTSD | Sensory/load triggered vs. trauma triggered |
| Emotional dysregulation | BPD | Episode pattern vs. overload pattern |
| Rigidity / routines | OCD | Regulatory vs. compulsion-driven |
| Emotional numbness | Depression | Labeling difficulty vs. anhedonia |
| Task paralysis | Depression | Structural initiation vs. motivation loss |
| Sensory sensitivity | Anxiety | Processing difference vs. threat anticipation |
| Time blindness | ADHD | Near-identical — note co-occurrence |
| Emotional flooding | ADHD | Co-occurs, partially shared mechanism |
| Sound sensitivity | APD | Major overlap — co-occurring common |
