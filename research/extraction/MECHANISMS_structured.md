# Mechanism: Sensory Gating and Habituation Failure

## Simple Explanation  
The brain normally stops paying attention to repeated, safe sounds or sights (like a ticking clock) to save energy. In autism, the brain often continues to react to these repeated stimuli as if they are new or important, leading to constant alertness and exhaustion.

## Biological Details  
This involves a failure in "habituation" (response reduction over time) and "gating" (filtering out redundant input). It is linked to altered alpha-band oscillatory gating and latency alterations in early evoked responses (e.g., N100 gating) [1], [2]. Neurologically, this reflects reduced cortical adaptation and diminished amygdala habituation, keeping the salience network active [3], [4].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-01-auditory-hypersensitivity]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-05-filtering-background-noise]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypical brains rapidly reduce neural firing rates in response to repetitive stimuli (habituation). Autistic brains show reduced or slower habituation, meaning background noise remains highly salient and "non-automatic," requiring active effort to ignore [3].

## Key Research Findings  
- Autistic adults show reduced auditory cortical adaptation (repetition suppression) in fMRI studies despite intact initial responses [3].  
- Amygdala responses to faces show diminished habituation, maintaining a state of social vigilance [4].  
- Youth studies show greater skin conductance responses (SCR) to mildly aversive stimuli and reduced heart-rate deceleration, indicating elevated defensive arousal [5].

mechanism-thalamocortical-filtering.md  
# Mechanism: Thalamocortical Filtering

## Simple Explanation  
The thalamus acts as a gatekeeper for the brain, deciding which sensory information is important enough to send to the thinking parts of the brain (cortex). In autism, this gate may be "leaky" or open too wide, flooding the cortex with too much raw sensory data.

## Biological Details  
This involves atypical functional connectivity between the thalamus and the cortex (thalamocortical gating). It is hypothesized to result from altered GABAergic inhibitory tone in the thalamic reticular nucleus, which fails to suppress or "gate" irrelevant sensory input before it reaches processing areas [7], [8].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-01-auditory-hypersensitivity]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-02-visual-overwhelm]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypical brains exhibit effective "gating," where the thalamus inhibits irrelevant signals. Autistic brains often show thalamocortical hyperconnectivity, suggesting a failure to "turn down the gain" on sensory input [7], [8].

## Key Research Findings  
- Large-sample analyses (ABIDE) and adult cohorts confirm thalamocortical connectivity alterations [7].  
- Reduced thalamic GABA concentrations are linked to sensory over-responsivity (SOR), supporting the "leaky gate" hypothesis [3].  
- This dysconnectivity relates to the difficulty in filtering background noise and the sensation of being overwhelmed [7].

mechanism-excitation-inhibition-balance.md  
# Mechanism: Excitation-Inhibition Imbalance (GABA/Glutamate)

## Simple Explanation  
Brain activity relies on a balance between "go" signals (excitation) and "stop" signals (inhibition). A reduction in the "stop" signals (GABA) creates a noisy neural environment where it is difficult to tune out distractions or control responses.

## Biological Details  
This refers to the ratio of excitatory (glutamate) to inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission. In adults, altered GABAergic tone is observed in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex [8]. This imbalance affects the "gain control" of neural circuits, influencing sensory sensitivity and executive control [8].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-01-auditory-hypersensitivity]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-24-masking-camouflaging]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypical brains maintain a stable E:I balance that allows for efficient signal-to-noise processing. Autistic brains may show reduced inhibitory tone, leading to "neural noise" [8]. In autistic women, preserved E:I markers in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) are associated with better camouflaging ability [9].

## Key Research Findings  
- Adult PET-MR and MRS studies show altered thalamic and prefrontal GABA concentrations [8].  
- Sex-by-diagnosis differences exist; in autistic men, vMPFC signal suggests increased excitation, while autistic women show different patterns linked to masking [9].  
- Lower inhibitory tone correlates with sensory over-responsivity [3].

mechanism-social-prediction-theory-of-mind.md  
# Mechanism: Social Prediction and Theory of Mind

## Simple Explanation  
Instead of automatically knowing what others are thinking or feeling, the autistic brain often processes social interaction manually using logic and rules. This makes social situations a high-effort "calculation" rather than an intuitive feeling.

## Biological Details  
This involves the "mentalizing network," specifically the Default Mode Network (DMN), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) [10]. Differences are seen in the recruitment and connectivity of these regions, particularly during self-representation and social inference [10], [11].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-07-literal-interpretation]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-08-missing-implicit-social-rules]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypical brains show automatic engagement of the DMN and TPJ for social inference. Autistic brains may show reduced activation in the right TPJ during mentalizing or require compensatory recruitment of prefrontal control systems to achieve similar outcomes [11].

## Key Research Findings  
- Meta-analysis of fMRI theory-of-mind tasks identifies group differences in activation patterns of core mentalizing nodes [10].  
- Autistic men show reduced rTPJ activation during mentalizing compared to controls [11].  
- High-masking autistic women show heightened vMPFC response during self-representation, suggesting effortful compensatory processing [11].

mechanism-face-processing-ffa.md  
# Mechanism: Face Processing (Fusiform Face Area)

## Simple Explanation  
For most people, recognizing a face is instant and automatic. For autistic adults, the brain does not "learn" faces as quickly, meaning looking at a face remains as effortful the tenth time as it was the first time.

## Biological Details  
This involves the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and broader face-processing networks. The key mechanism is a specific reduction in "repetition suppression" (RS) for faces [13]. RS is the brain's way of becoming efficient; its absence implies faces do not trigger automatic plasticity [13].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-09-face-blindness]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-06-eye-contact-difficulty]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
In neurotypicals, neural activity in the FFA decreases when viewing a face repeatedly (habituation/efficiency). In autistic adults, this reduction is absent or blunted specifically for faces, even if it is normal for objects [13].

## Key Research Findings  
- Adult fMRI shows selective reduction in repetition suppression for faces, but not for objects or words [13].  
- Functional connectivity and white-matter microstructure between face-recognition regions are altered [13].  
- Amygdala habituation to faces is diminished, leading to sustained salience/vigilance [4].

# Mechanism: Executive Function and Cognitive Control

## Simple Explanation  
The brain's "management team" (executive function) struggles to switch tasks or filter out distractions, leading to a bottleneck. It's not necessarily that the person *can't* do the task, but that the cost of starting, stopping, or switching is much higher.

## Biological Details  
This involves the superordinate cognitive control network (DLPFC, dorsal ACC, parietal regions) [15]. Deficits are prominent in working memory maintenance and "set shifting" (flexibility) [16]. "Monotropism" suggests high neural demand when recalibrating focus from one attention tunnel to another [17].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-11-task-initiation-paralysis]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-12-difficulty-with-transitions]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypicals can distribute attention (polytropism) and switch tasks with lower cognitive cost. Autistic brains exhibit a "transition cost" and may struggle with initiation specifically, which can be mistaken for poor inhibition [17], [18].

## Key Research Findings  
- Meta-analyses show robust working memory impairments across the lifespan [16].  
- Cognitive flexibility deficits (perseverative errors) are a consistent finding in adults [16].  
- Slower responding often reflects initiation difficulty rather than pure inhibition deficits [18].

mechanism-interoception-deficits.md  
# Mechanism: Interoception Deficits

## Simple Explanation  
The brain has trouble receiving or interpreting signals from the body (like heart rate, hunger, or tension). This leads to a disconnect where a person doesn't realize they are stressed or hungry until they are completely overwhelmed.

## Biological Details  
This involves atypical connectivity between the insula (which receives body signals) and the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) (which interprets them and selects a response) [20], [21]. It is closely linked to Alexithymia [22].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-16-alexithymia]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-17-delayed-emotional-realization]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypicals generally integrate physiological arousal (e.g., racing heart) with conscious awareness smoothly. Autistic brains often show a "decoupling" between physiological arousal and subjective feeling [23], or require compensatory prefrontal recruitment to interpret emotions [24].

## Key Research Findings  
- Autistic adults show a "decoupling" where physiological arousal does not match reported stress [23].  
- Alexithymia mediates many "empathy deficits," suggesting the issue is emotion sensing, not caring [22].  
- Heightened connectivity between the ventral anterior insula and lateral prefrontal cortex suggests "intellectualizing" body feelings [24].

# Mechanism: Predictive Processing Differences

## Simple Explanation  
The brain is a prediction machine, constantly guessing what will happen next. The autistic brain may treat small surprises (prediction errors) as highly important, making the world feel volatile, chaotic, and requiring rigid routines to manage.

## Biological Details  
This involves "precision-weighted prediction error" encoding. The brain may assign inflexibly high precision to prediction errors (HIPPEA account), mediated by noradrenergic gain signals (pupil-linked arousal) [26].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-22-need-for-sameness]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-02-visual-overwhelm]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypicals can ignore small mismatches between expectation and reality. Autistic brains may "over-learn" volatility, failing to habituate to changes and maintaining high vigilance [26].

## Key Research Findings  
- Autistic adults show altered volatility learning linked to pupil size (noradrenergic gain) [26].  
- Mismatch negativity (MMN) studies suggest context-dependent differences in error processing [27].  
- fMRI shows differences in higher-level hierarchical predictions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex) rather than a global deficit [27].

# Mechanism: Pattern Recognition Enhancement

## Simple Explanation  
The autistic brain can process more information at once without filtering it out, leading to an ability to notice details and patterns that others miss. This is often linked to "Monotropism" or deep, narrow focus.

## Biological Details  
This relates to "perceptual capacity" and local vs. global processing biases. Under high perceptual load, autistic adults preserve perceptual sensitivity better than neurotypicals [30]. This is supported by Monotropism, where resources are concentrated in "attention tunnels" [17].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-23-intense-narrow-interests]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-15-hyperfocus]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypical brains tend to prioritize global processing (the big picture) and filter out details when load increases. Autistic brains may show enhanced perceptual capacity, processing more stimuli rather than filtering them out [30].

## Key Research Findings  
- Signal-detection paradigms show autistic adults maintain sensitivity under high perceptual load where neurotypicals do not [30].  
- DMN connectivity patterns suggest a bias toward "salience" of all information, potentially explaining the "intense world" experience [31].  
- Monotropic focus allows for flow states that are highly absorbing [17].

mechanism-autonomic-nervous-system-dysregulation.md  
# Mechanism: Autonomic Nervous System Dysregulation

## Simple Explanation  
The body's automatic control system (for heart rate, digestion, etc.) acts like a car with a sensitive gas pedal and a sticky brake. This leads to getting stressed easily (sympathetic arousal) and having trouble calming down (reduced vagal tone).

## Biological Details  
This involves reduced Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac vagal modulation (parasympathetic braking) [5], [33]. It also involves the "defense cascade," where overwhelm can trigger mobilization (meltdown) or immobilization (shutdown/freeze) [34].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-19-meltdowns]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-20-shutdowns]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Autistic adults often show lower resting HRV and reduced physiological flexibility [33]. They may have a "thinner boundary" between safety and threat, engaging the fight-flight-freeze system at lower levels of stress [35].

## Key Research Findings  
- Meta-analysis shows lower HRV in autism, suggesting reduced vagal tone [33].  
- Sensory stimulation triggers greater skin conductance and reduced heart-rate deceleration (orienting), indicating a defensive stance [5].  
- "Freeze" responses involve mixed sympathetic activation with parasympathetic braking, explaining the "shutdown" state [34].

## Evidence Strength  
Strong for HRV differences [33]

mechanism-stress-response-allostatic-load.md  
# Mechanism: Stress Response and Allostatic Load

## Simple Explanation  
Living in a world that isn't built for you causes constant low-level stress. Over time, this cumulative stress wears down the body's systems (allostatic load), leading to burnout and physical health problems.

## Biological Details  
This involves the HPA axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) and cortisol regulation. Chronic activation leads to HPA axis dysregulation, manifesting as either hyper- or hypocortisolism (adrenal fatigue) [36], [37].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-18-emotional-flooding]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-14-decision-fatigue]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Autistic adults report more lifetime stressors and higher perceived stress severity [38]. While acute cortisol responses in labs are mixed, hair cortisol (chronic measure) is linked to camouflaging efforts, indicating a sustained physiological cost not seen in neurotypicals [37].

## Key Research Findings  
- Autistic adults perceive daily life events as significantly more stressful than controls [38].  
- Camouflaging is associated with altered hair cortisol concentrations, suggesting a biological cost to "fitting in" [37].  
- The cumulative "wear and tear" (allostatic load) explains the high rates of autistic burnout [36], [39].

mechanism-dopamine-reward-system-differences.md  
# Mechanism: Dopamine Reward System Differences

## Simple Explanation  
The brain's reward system may respond differently to social cues versus personal interests. This can make social interaction feel less inherently rewarding and "special interests" feel intensely pleasurable and focusing.

## Biological Details  
This involves the dopaminergic reward system and the hypothalamus. In the context of "Monotropism," interest-based flow states are highly organizing [17]. In masking, hypothalamic connectivity with reward regions is linked to cognitive control, suggesting social reward is "computed" rather than felt automatically [41].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-23-intense-narrow-interests]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-11-task-initiation-paralysis]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
While ADHD is characterized by a general dopamine deficit (seeking novelty), autism is characterized by "attention tunnels" or Monotropism [17]. Social motivation pathways may differ, with hypothalamic-reward connectivity supporting camouflaging efforts in women [41].

## Key Research Findings  
- Monotropic focus creates "flow states" that are difficult to interrupt [17].  
- Hypothalamic connectivity with limbic reward regions is positively associated with camouflaging in autistic women [41].  
- This differs from the ADHD "interest-based nervous system" which is driven by a need for stimulation to overcome inhibition deficits [42].

mechanism-cognitive-load-processing-bandwidth.md  
# Mechanism: Cognitive Load and Processing Bandwidth

## Simple Explanation  
Everyone has a limit on how much information they can process at once (bandwidth). For autistic adults, everyday things like sensory noise, social rules, and changes in routine take up huge amounts of this bandwidth, leaving little room for anything else.

## Biological Details  
This involves Working Memory capacity and processing speed. Autistic adults often show a "spiky profile" with slower processing speed acting as a bottleneck [43]. Extraneous load (sensory/social) consumes resources needed for tasks [44].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-14-decision-fatigue]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-10-delayed-social-processing]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Processing speed in autistic adults is often \~1 standard deviation below the mean, acting as a rate-limiter [43]. Neurotypicals process social/sensory input automatically (low load), whereas autistic adults often process it manually (high load) [44].

## Key Research Findings  
- Processing speed is a notable weakness (medium impairment) even when reasoning skills are high [45], [43].  
- High "extraneous load" (noise, ambiguity) degrades performance by consuming limited working memory [44].  
- Time constraints significantly reduce cognitive control capacity in autistic adults [46].

# Mechanism: Neural Connectivity Patterns (Local vs Global)

## Simple Explanation  
The brain is wired differently: it may have too many connections for close-up details (local) and not enough strong connections for big-picture integration (global). This leads to being great at details but struggling to connect them into a whole.

## Biological Details  
This involves "thalamocortical hyperconnectivity" [7] and reduced "long-range" connectivity in networks like the Default Mode Network (DMN) [10]. The DMN may also lack differentiation from the "salience network," making everything feel equally important [31].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-07-literal-interpretation]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-09-face-blindness]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
Neurotypical brains show strong long-range integration and distinct separation between "task-positive" and "resting" networks. Autistic brains show atypical integration, such as the DMN not "shutting off" during tasks, or excessive coupling between sensory and salience networks [31].

## Key Research Findings  
- Thalamocortical hyperconnectivity is a consistent finding in adults [7].  
- DMN connectivity is often reduced and shows node-specific heterogeneity [10].  
- Lack of differentiation between DMN and salience networks supports the "Intense World Theory" [31].

# Mechanism: Masking Compensation Networks

## Simple Explanation  
To appear "normal," the autistic brain uses different, more expensive circuits. It recruits high-level thinking areas to manually perform social tasks that neurotypicals do automatically, which burns a lot of energy.

## Biological Details  
This involves "neural compensation." High-masking adults recruit the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vMPFC) and executive control networks to manage self-representation and social output [11]. It relies on distributed connectivity between reward, emotion, and memory circuits [49].

## What This Explains  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-24-masking-camouflaging]  
- Behavior: [Link to behavior-20-shutdowns]

## How It Differs from Neurotypical  
In neurotypical women, social self-representation is automatic. In high-masking autistic women, vMPFC activation increases with camouflaging effort, indicating a top-down, resource-intensive strategy [11].

## Key Research Findings  
- Greater camouflaging is associated with heightened vMPFC response during self-representation tasks in autistic women [11].  
- Hypothalamic connectivity with cognitive control regions supports masking, linking it to stress/reward systems [41].  
- Preserved E:I balance in the prefrontal cortex is linked to better camouflaging ability, suggesting it requires high neural stability [9].
