# Strategy: Noise-Canceling Headphones

## What It Is  
The use of active noise-canceling technology (ANC) or passive isolation to attenuate background auditory input.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (during crisis/overload)  
- Preventive (during commute, office work, or shopping)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces the "extraneous load" on the auditory system, preventing the sympathetic nervous system activation (fight/flight) typically triggered by inability to filter background noise. This directly addresses the failure of thalamocortical gating.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Purchase over-ear headphones with high-quality ANC.  
2. Wear them during high-risk transitions (e.g., public transport).  
3. Use "transparency mode" only when interaction is required, then immediately switch back to isolation.

## Variations  
- High-fidelity earplugs (e.g., Loop, Flare) for social situations where total isolation is unsafe or socially difficult.  
- Brown noise or white noise played through headphones to mask irregular sounds.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; widely validated by user reporting and studies showing reduced sympathetic activation (EDA).

## Works Best For  
- Auditory hypersensitivity  
- Meltdown prevention  
- Workplace focus

## May Not Work If  
- The pressure of headphones causes tactile allodynia (pain from touch).  
- The user requires auditory cues for safety (e.g., driving).

# Strategy: Sunglasses / Blue Light Blocking

## What It Is  
Wearing tinted lenses or sunglasses indoors and outdoors to reduce visual intensity and flicker.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (in offices, stores, or under fluorescent lights)  
- Recovery (during migraines or shutdown)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces visual stress caused by sub-visible flicker and glare from artificial lighting, which can trigger the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system (arousal). It mitigates the "visual overwhelm" response.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Keep FL-41 (rose tint) or polarized sunglasses in a daily carry bag.  
2. Wear them immediately upon entering big-box stores or offices with fluorescent lighting.  
3. Install blue-light filtering software (e.g., f.lux) on all digital devices.

## Variations  
- Wearing a baseball cap or wide-brimmed hat to physically block overhead light sources.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; supported by research on visual stress and lighting impact on autistic adults.

## Works Best For  
- Visual hypersensitivity  
- Preventing headaches/migraines  
- Reducing fatigue in office environments

## May Not Work If  
- The tint obscures necessary visual details for work.

strategy-sensory-fidget-tools.md  
# Strategy: Fidget Tools (Stimming)

## What It Is  
The use of handheld objects (spinners, cubes, textured items) to provide regulated sensory input.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (during anxiety or waiting)  
- Preventive (during meetings or focus tasks)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Provides predictable, repetitive motor or tactile input that helps modulate arousal levels. It can calm an over-responsive system or alert an under-responsive one, aiding in focus and regulation.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Identify preferred sensory input (clicky, soft, resistance).  
2. Keep discreet fidgets in pockets or attached to keys/lanyards.  
3. Use during listening tasks to maintain attention and reduce anxiety.

## Variations  
- "Stealth" stimming: playing with a ring, pen clicking, or fabric rubbing.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; aligns with theories of sensory seeking and arousal modulation.

## Works Best For  
- ADHD/Autism overlap  
- Anxiety reduction  
- Maintaining focus during passive listening

## May Not Work If  
- The specific fidget creates noise that distracts others (social friction).

strategy-sensory-weighted-blankets.md  
# Strategy: Weighted Blankets

## What It Is  
Using a heavy blanket (typically 10% of body weight) to provide deep pressure stimulation (DPS) over the whole body.

## When to Use  
- Recovery (after a long day)  
- Preventive (for sleep onset)  
- Immediate (during meltdown recovery)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Deep pressure activates the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) and increases dopamine and serotonin while reducing cortisol. It mimics the calming effect of firm holding or hugging without social demand.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Select a blanket that is roughly 10% of your body weight.  
2. Use it during "decompression time" immediately after arriving home.  
3. Sleep under it to improve sleep continuity.

## Variations  
- Compression garments (tight undershirts) for daytime use.  
- Weighted lap pads for desk work.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; inconsistent across meta-analyses but high clinical consensus for calming.

## Works Best For  
- Proprioceptive seekers  
- Insomnia  
- High anxiety/arousal states

## May Not Work If  
- The individual has tactile defensiveness to pressure or claustrophobia.

strategy-sensory-breaks.md  
# Strategy: Sensory Breaks

## What It Is  
Scheduled short periods of withdrawal from sensory input to prevent cumulative overload.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (scheduled every 2-3 hours)  
- Recovery (when early warning signs appear)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Prevents the nervous system from reaching its "threshold" for meltdown. By reducing afferent drive into the salience network, it allows the brain's filtering mechanisms to reset.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Schedule 10-minute blocks in your calendar.  
2. Go to a quiet, dim place (bathroom, car, quiet room).  
3. Eliminate input: close eyes, use headphones, no phone scrolling.

## Variations  
- "Micro-breaks": closing eyes and covering ears for 2 minutes.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; foundational in "sensory diet" approaches to prevent burnout.

## Works Best For  
- Preventing meltdowns  
- Managing open-plan offices  
- Long social events

## May Not Work If  
- The environment has no accessible safe/quiet space.

# Strategy: Environmental Control

## What It Is  
Modifying the physical environment to minimize sensory triggers, such as lighting, noise, and layout.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (home/office setup)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces extraneous cognitive load. By removing "hazard" inputs (flicker, hum), working memory and attention resources are preserved for actual tasks rather than filtering.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Replace fluorescent bulbs with warm LEDs or use floor lamps.  
2. Use acoustic treatments (rugs, curtains) to dampen echo.  
3. Position desks away from high-traffic areas or visual distractions.

## Variations  
- "Work from home" accommodations to control the entire sensory setting.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; strongly supported by architectural and occupational therapy research.

## Works Best For  
- Long-term sustainability  
- Home and office productivity

## May Not Work If  
- You do not have control over the environment (e.g., retail work).

#### Social Management

strategy-social-communication-scripts.md  
# Strategy: Communication Scripts

## What It Is  
Pre-written phrases or templates for common social interactions to reduce the need for spontaneous generation.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (during phone calls, ordering food)  
- Preventive (preparing for meetings)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces the cognitive load and working memory demand of "calculating" a social response. It bypasses the processing speed bottleneck by having the answer ready-made.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Write down scripts for common scenarios (e.g., declining an invitation, scheduling an appointment).  
2. Keep a "cheat sheet" near the phone or computer.  
3. Practice the script mentally before the interaction.

## Variations  
- Digital templates for emails.  
- Text-to-speech apps if verbal speech is difficult.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate to High; widely used and effective for reducing social anxiety and load.

## Works Best For  
- Task initiation paralysis related to communication  
- Situational mutism  
- Reducing social anxiety

## May Not Work If  
- The conversation deviates unexpectedly from the script (requires flexibility).

# Strategy: Email vs. Phone Preference

## What It Is  
Requesting and prioritizing asynchronous written communication over synchronous verbal communication.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (workplace accommodation, appointment booking)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Compensates for delayed social processing and auditory processing difficulties. It allows time to process information and formulate a response without the pressure of immediate reciprocity.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Set voicemail greeting to "Please email me at..."  
2. Explicitly request written instructions in the workplace.  
3. Use online booking systems for appointments whenever possible.

## Variations  
- Using chat/instant messaging (semi-synchronous) instead of video calls.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; linked to improved job stability and satisfaction.

## Works Best For  
- Auditory processing disorder  
- Delayed processing speed  
- Workplace anxiety

## May Not Work If  
- The job requires immediate verbal crisis management.

strategy-social-battery-tracking.md  
# Strategy: Social Battery Tracking

## What It Is  
Monitoring social energy levels to prevent depletion, treating social energy as a finite resource.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (daily planning)  
- Recovery (deciding when to leave an event)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Prevents "allostatic overload" by ensuring demands do not exceed capacity. It uses metacognition to manage the "energy bank account."

## Implementation Steps  
1. Rate your "social battery" from 0-100% each morning.  
2. Assign "costs" to upcoming social events.  
3. If the battery is low, cancel or reschedule non-essential interactions.

## Variations  
- Color-coded wristbands to signal social availability to family/partners.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Strong anecdotal support; aligns with energy accounting frameworks.

## Works Best For  
- Preventing burnout  
- Managing introversion/autism overlap

## May Not Work If  
- Work or family obligations prevent withdrawal despite low battery.

strategy-social-scheduled-time.md  
# Strategy: Scheduled Social Time with Recovery

## What It Is  
Limiting social interactions to specific, bounded times and immediately scheduling recovery time afterwards.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (weekly planning)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces the "uncertainty" and "switch costs" associated with spontaneous socializing. Knowing there is a defined end time and a recovery plan lowers the threat appraisal.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Define a start and end time for all social gatherings.  
2. Block out "do not disturb" time immediately following the event.  
3. Stick to the end time even if having fun, to prevent "borrowing" energy from tomorrow.

## Variations  
- "Batching" meetings into one day to leave other days free.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; supported by task switching and cognitive load literature.

## Works Best For  
- Managing fatigue  
- Maintaining friendships without burnout

## May Not Work If  
- Social obligations are unpredictable or emergencies arise.

# Strategy: Explicit Communication Requests

## What It Is  
Asking others to state their needs, feelings, and instructions directly, avoiding hints or subtext.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (establishing relationship norms)  
- Immediate (when confused)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces the "prediction error" and cognitive load required to decode implied meaning (Theory of Mind). It bridges the "Double Empathy" gap.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Explain: "I process information best when it is direct. Please tell me exactly what you need."  
2. Ask clarifying questions: "Are you asking me to do X, or just sharing information?"  
3. Establish a "no hints" policy with close friends/partners.

## Variations  
- "Safe words" to signal when a conversation is becoming too abstract or emotional.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; reduces workplace friction and social anxiety.

## Works Best For  
- Literal interpreters  
- Workplace clarity  
- Relationship conflict reduction

## May Not Work If  
- The communication partner refuses to adapt or finds directness "rude."

# Strategy: Time-Delayed Responses

## What It Is  
Buying time during conversations to process information before responding.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (during questions or decisions)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Accommodates slower processing speed and reduces the pressure of "real-time" performance, allowing executive functions to engage.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Use a standard phrase: "I need to think about that. I'll get back to you."  
2. "Let me check my calendar" (even if you know you are free).  
3. Take a sip of water to create a natural pause.

## Variations  
- The "24-hour rule" for agreeing to any new commitment.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Strong; aligns with findings on processing speed bottlenecks in autism.

## Works Best For  
- Preventing over-commitment  
- Reducing decision fatigue  
- Auditory processing issues

## May Not Work If  
- Immediate emergency decisions are required.

#### Executive Function

strategy-executive-external-structure.md  
# Strategy: External Structure (Timers, Alarms, Lists)

## What It Is  
Using external tools to replace internal executive control for monitoring time and tasks.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (daily setup)  
- Immediate (during hyperfocus)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Offloads the demand from the prefrontal cortex/working memory to the environment. It provides "prosthetic" executive function.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Set multiple alarms for transitions (e.g., "10 mins until leave," "5 mins until leave").  
2. Use visual timers (Time Timer) to see the passage of time.  
3. Keep physical lists visible (whiteboards), not hidden in apps.

## Variations  
- Smart home reminders (Alexa/Google) for routine tasks.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; standard of care for executive dysfunction.

## Works Best For  
- Time blindness  
- Task initiation  
- Transition management

## May Not Work If  
- The individual becomes "alarm blind" (habituates) to the sound.

strategy-executive-body-doubling.md  
# Strategy: Body Doubling

## What It Is  
Working alongside another person (in person or virtually) who is also working, to facilitate focus and task initiation.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (for difficult or boring tasks)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Provides "social anchoring" and co-regulation. The presence of another person signals safety and accountability, potentially engaging dopaminergic motivation pathways to overcome inertia.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Ask a friend/partner to sit with you while you clean or work.  
2. Join a virtual body doubling platform (e.g., Focusmate).  
3. State your goal to the body double before starting.

## Variations  
- "Parallel play" for chores.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Emerging; strong anecdotal support and theoretical alignment with co-regulation.

## Works Best For  
- Task initiation paralysis  
- Boring/mundane tasks  
- ADHD/Autism overlap

## May Not Work If  
- The body double is distracting or talks too much.

strategy-executive-task-chunking.md  
# Strategy: Task Chunking

## What It Is  
Breaking down complex tasks into extremely small, concrete micro-steps.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (when facing task paralysis)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces the cognitive load and "threshold" for initiation. By making the first step negligible in effort, it bypasses the amygdala's threat response to a large, overwhelming project.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Write down the goal (e.g., "Clean kitchen").  
2. Break it down: "Stand up," "Walk to sink," "Wash one fork."  
3. Focus only on the immediate micro-step.

## Variations  
- "The 5-minute rule": commit to doing the task for only 5 minutes.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; foundational in CBT and executive function coaching.

## Works Best For  
- Overwhelm  
- Autistic inertia  
- Large projects

## May Not Work If  
- The individual cannot visualize the steps (requires support/templates).

# Strategy: Visual Schedules

## What It Is  
Using visual representations (calendars, icons, color-coding) to map out the day or week.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (daily/weekly planning)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Externalizes working memory and reduces anxiety by increasing predictability. It helps the brain "see" time and sequence, which is often abstract and difficult to grasp.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Use a physical wall calendar or whiteboard.  
2. Color-code different types of activities (work, rest, social).  
3. Review the schedule visually every morning.

## Variations  
- Digital calendars with visual widgets.  
- "First/Then" boards for specific task sequences.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate to High; widely used in autism support.

## Works Best For  
- Anxiety reduction  
- Time management  
- Routine maintenance

## May Not Work If  
- The schedule is too rigid and a change occurs (needs flexibility).

strategy-executive-transition-rituals.md  
# Strategy: Transition Rituals

## What It Is  
Standardized routines performed between tasks to bridge the gap and signal a shift in focus.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (between work and home, or task A and B)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces "transition cost" and "monotropic split." The ritual provides a buffer that allows the brain to disengage from one attention tunnel and recalibrate for the next, reducing the cognitive shock.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Choose a bridge activity (e.g., listening to a specific song, changing clothes, making tea).  
2. Perform this action consistently every time you switch contexts.  
3. Allow adequate time for the ritual; do not rush it.

## Variations  
- "Commute" simulation for working from home (walking around the block).

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; supported by literature on switch costs and monotropism.

## Works Best For  
- Difficulty switching tasks  
- Autistic inertia  
- Work-life balance

## May Not Work If  
- The ritual itself becomes a rigid obsession that cannot be skipped.

# Strategy: Decision Pre-making (Routines)

## What It Is  
Reducing daily choices by establishing fixed routines for recurring events (meals, clothes).

## When to Use  
- Preventive (lifestyle design)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Conserves executive function resources by automating behavior. It reduces "decision fatigue" by removing the need to process options and make choices for mundane things.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Create a weekly meal plan or eat the same breakfast daily.  
2. Adopt a "uniform" or capsule wardrobe.  
3. Automate bill payments and household supply orders.

## Variations  
- "Steve Jobs" approach to clothing.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; effective for load management.

## Works Best For  
- Decision fatigue  
- Morning routines  
- Energy conservation

## May Not Work If  
- The routine is disrupted by external factors (supply chain, weather).

#### Emotional Regulation

strategy-emotional-interoception-body-scans.md  
# Strategy: Interoception Body Scans

## What It Is  
Systematically checking in with physical sensations to build awareness of internal states.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (daily practice)  
- Recovery (post-meltdown)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Strengthens the neural pathways between the insula (body signals) and the anterior cingulate cortex (awareness). It improves "body literacy" to detect stress/needs before they reach crisis levels.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Sit or lie down in a quiet place.  
2. Scan the body from toes to head.  
3. Ask specific questions: "Is my jaw tight? Is my stomach empty? Are my shoulders up?"

## Variations  
- Using an "emotion wheel" mapped to body sensations.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; supported by interoception research and alexithymia interventions.

## Works Best For  
- Alexithymia  
- Preventing "out of the blue" meltdowns  
- Anxiety management

## May Not Work If  
- The individual finds focusing on the body triggering (trauma history).

# Strategy: Emotion Labeling Practice

## What It Is  
Explicitly identifying and naming emotions to improve regulation.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (journaling)  
- Immediate (during distress)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
"Name it to tame it": labeling an emotion engages the prefrontal cortex, which can dampen amygdala reactivity. It addresses alexithymia by bridging the gap between feeling and knowing.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Use an "emotion wheel" or visual chart.  
2. When feeling a sensation, try to match it to a word.  
3. Say or write: "I am feeling [Emotion] because [Reason]."

## Variations  
- Using colors or metaphors if words are difficult.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Strong; a core component of DBT and emotional regulation therapies.

## Works Best For  
- Alexithymia  
- Emotion dysregulation  
- Communication of needs

## May Not Work If  
- The individual is in full meltdown (language centers offline).

# Strategy: Cooling Down Protocols

## What It Is  
Using temperature (cold) to rapidly reduce physiological arousal.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (during panic or meltdown onset)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Activates the "mammalian dive reflex" (via cold water on the face), which slows the heart rate and stimulates the vagus nerve (parasympathetic system), actively countering the fight/flight response.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Splash ice-cold water on the face or hold an ice pack to the chest/neck.  
2. Hold an ice cube in the hand (intense sensory distraction).  
3. Drink a glass of very cold water.

## Variations  
- Stepping into cold air or a cold shower.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; widely used in DBT (TIPP skills) for distress tolerance.

## Works Best For  
- Meltdowns  
- Panic attacks  
- Extreme anger/agitation

## May Not Work If  
- The individual has cold urticaria or sensory aversion to cold.

# Strategy: Safe Shutdown Spaces

## What It Is  
Designating a specific physical location for recovery during overload or shutdown.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (when shutdown begins)  
- Recovery

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Removes afferent sensory drive and social demands, allowing the nervous system to reboot. It provides safety and containment when executive function and language fail.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Create a "nest": closet, corner, or under a blanket.  
2. Stock it with comfort items (pillows, weighted blanket, noise defenders).  
3. Inform household members: "When I am in the nest, do not disturb me."

## Variations  
- A "tent" over the bed.  
- Booking a meeting room alone at work.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; aligns with sensory reduction and recovery needs.

## Works Best For  
- Shutdowns  
- Sensory overload  
- Autistic burnout

## May Not Work If  
- Space is unavailable (e.g., in public).

# Strategy: Physical Grounding Techniques

## What It Is  
Using strong physical sensations to reconnect with the body and the present moment.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (dissociation, panic, anxiety)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Redirects attention from internal chaos/trauma memories to immediate external reality. Proprioceptive input (firm touch, floor contact) can help regulate the nervous system.

## Implementation Steps  
1. "5-4-3-2-1" technique: Name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.  
2. Push feet firmly into the floor or push hands against a wall.  
3. Describe an object in the room in minute detail.

## Variations  
- Holding a textured object (stone, fabric).

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate to High; standard for dissociation and anxiety.

## Works Best For  
- Dissociation  
- Anxiety attacks  
- Depersonalization

## May Not Work If  
- The individual is in a shutdown state where processing verbal instructions is impossible.

# Strategy: Nervous System Regulation (Breathing/Movement)

## What It Is  
Using controlled breathing or rhythmic movement to shift autonomic state.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (daily)  
- Immediate (early signs of stress)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Slow, rhythmic breathing (especially long exhalations) stimulates the vagus nerve, increasing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and promoting a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Box breathing: Inhale 4s, Hold 4s, Exhale 4s, Hold 4s.  
2. 4-7-8 breathing: Inhale 4s, Hold 7s, Exhale 8s.  
3. Rhythmic rocking or swaying (linear vestibular input).

## Variations  
- Biofeedback devices to train HRV.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; HRV biofeedback and paced breathing are evidence-based for anxiety and autonomic regulation.

## Works Best For  
- Generalized anxiety  
- Raising stress threshold  
- Recovery

## May Not Work If  
- Focusing on breath causes hyperventilation/anxiety (use movement instead).

#### Energy Management

strategy-energy-accounting-system.md  
# Strategy: Energy Accounting System

## What It Is  
A conceptual framework for budgeting mental and emotional energy, treating it like a bank account with deposits and withdrawals.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (weekly/daily planning)  
- Recovery (burnout management)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Prevents allostatic overload by making the invisible cost of activities visible. It forces a balance between draining tasks (withdrawals) and restorative ones (deposits).

## Implementation Steps  
1. List activities that drain you (work, socializing, sensory exposure) and assign points (e.g., -10).  
2. List activities that recharge you (special interests, solitude) and assign points (e.g., \+10).  
3. Plan your week to ensure the net total is positive or neutral.

## Variations  
- "Spoon theory" (counting spoons).

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; widely adopted in autism therapy and burnout recovery.

## Works Best For  
- Burnout prevention  
- Activity pacing  
- Self-advocacy

# Strategy: Rest Scheduling

## What It Is  
Proactively scheduling rest periods *before* exhaustion sets in.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (daily)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Prevents the accumulation of fatigue and allostatic load. Sleep and rest are primary recovery channels for cognitive control and physiological stress regulation.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Treat rest as a non-negotiable appointment in the calendar.  
2. Practice "aggressive resting": lying down in a dark room with no input for 20 mins.  
3. Prioritize sleep hygiene (same wake/sleep times).

## Variations  
- "Nap discs" or "Non-Sleep Deep Rest" (NSDR) protocols.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; supports physiological recovery and cognitive maintenance.

## Works Best For  
- Chronic fatigue  
- Burnout recovery  
- Sensory processing sensitivity

## May Not Work If  
- Sleep disorders (insomnia) prevent effective rest.

# Strategy: Unmasking Time

## What It Is  
Allocating specific times or spaces where camouflaging behaviors are consciously dropped.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (daily)  
- Recovery

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces the cognitive load of self-monitoring and the physiological stress (cortisol/HPA axis) associated with suppression. It allows the nervous system to return to baseline.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Identify "safe" people or places where masking isn't needed.  
2. Allow yourself to stim, not make eye contact, or use natural communication styles.  
3. Spend time alone engaging in special interests without judgment.

## Variations  
- Joining neurodivergent peer groups where unmasking is the norm.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; reduced masking is linked to lower stress and burnout risk.

## Works Best For  
- High-masking adults  
- Autistic burnout  
- Identity integration

## May Not Work If  
- The individual feels unsafe unmasking due to stigma/trauma.

# Strategy: Capacity Monitoring

## What It Is  
Regularly assessing current functional capacity, recognizing that it fluctuates based on stress and load.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (morning check-in)  
- Preventive

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Uses metacognition to detect early warning signs of overload (threshold proximity). Allows for real-time adjustment of demands to prevent "overshoot" into meltdown.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Ask: "What is my capacity today? (Low, Medium, High)".  
2. Adjust expectations: "Today is a low capacity day; I will only do the essentials."  
3. Track patterns: "I always have low capacity on Fridays."

## Variations  
- Using apps or journals to track stress/energy levels.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; supported by operational models of load capacity.

## Works Best For  
- Variable functioning  
- preventing "boom and bust" cycles  
- Self-compassion

## May Not Work If  
- Interoception is too poor to accurately gauge capacity.

# Strategy: Burnout Prevention Protocols

## What It Is  
A systematic approach to reducing long-term demands and increasing supports to match capacity.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (long-term lifestyle)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Restores the balance between allostatic load (wear and tear) and recovery. It prevents the chronic HPA axis dysregulation associated with burnout.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Conduct an audit of all life demands (work, social, sensory).  
2. Reduce demands: say no, delegate, lower standards.  
3. Increase resources: therapy, accommodations, sensory aids.  
4. Prioritize special interests as "restorative."

## Variations  
- Taking a leave of absence or changing jobs to a more autism-friendly environment.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; consensus in autistic-led research and clinical guidelines.

## Works Best For  
- Chronic exhaustion  
- Mid-life diagnosis  
- Prevention of relapse

## May Not Work If  
- Systemic barriers prevent demand reduction (e.g., poverty).

# Strategy: Recovery Rituals

## What It Is  
Specific, engaging activities used to reboot the brain after exertion, often involving special interests.

## When to Use  
- Recovery (daily/weekly)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Leverages "monotropism" (intense interest) to generate flow states, which are restorative and organizing for the autistic brain. It provides a positive "deposit" in the energy bank.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Identify activities that give you energy (gaming, reading, organizing).  
2. Schedule them as "prescribed" recovery, not "leisure" or "wasted time."  
3. Engage deeply without guilt.

## Variations  
- "Rotting" (lying in bed doing nothing) as a valid recovery stage.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Strong qualitative evidence; supports neuroplastic recovery.

## Works Best For  
- Autistic burnout  
- Mood regulation  
- Joy/Quality of life

## May Not Work If  
- Depression (anhedonia) blocks interest engagement.

#### Communication

strategy-communication-boundary-scripts.md  
# Strategy: Boundary Scripts

## What It Is  
Pre-planned phrases to set limits on time, energy, and sensory exposure.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (when demands arise)  
- Preventive

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces the cognitive load and emotional labor of self-advocacy. It protects capacity and prevents "fawning" or over-compliance.

## Implementation Steps  
1. "I can't do that right now, but I can do X."  
2. "I need to leave now to recharge."  
3. "I am at capacity and cannot take on more tasks."

## Variations  
- Written templates for declining work requests.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; essential for demand reduction and burnout prevention.

## Works Best For  
- People-pleasing/fawning  
- Burnout prevention  
- Setting expectations

## May Not Work If  
- Power dynamics make setting boundaries unsafe.

# Strategy: Accommodation Requests

## What It Is  
Formal or informal requests for adjustments to the work or social environment.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (starting a job, school)  
- Immediate (when barriers arise)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Modifies the environment to fit the neurobiological profile (person-environment fit), reducing extraneous load and preventing disability.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Identify the specific barrier (e.g., "lights are too bright").  
2. Identify the solution (e.g., "dimmer switch" or "lamp").  
3. Frame the request around productivity: "I work best when..."

## Variations  
- Using official HR processes vs. informal agreements with managers.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
High; linked to improved job retention and satisfaction.

## Works Best For  
- Workplace success  
- Education  
- Sustainable functioning

## May Not Work If  
- The employer/institution is unsupportive or discriminatory.

# Strategy: Disclosure Strategies

## What It Is  
Deciding when, how, and to whom to disclose an autism diagnosis or neurodivergent traits.

## When to Use  
- Preventive (strategic planning)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Balances the access to support/understanding against the risk of stigma. Selective disclosure can open doors to accommodations and reduce the stress of masking.

## Implementation Steps  
1. Assess safety and necessity: "Do I need an accommodation? Is this person safe?"  
2. Partial disclosure: "I have sensory processing issues" vs "I am Autistic."  
3. Full disclosure: "I am Autistic, which means X, Y, Z."

## Variations  
- "Soft disclosure" (mentioning traits without the label).

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; context-dependent (risk vs. reward).

## Works Best For  
- Accessing rights/protections  
- Building authentic relationships  
- Self-advocacy

## May Not Work If  
- The environment is hostile or prejudiced.

# Strategy: Conflict De-escalation

## What It Is  
Strategies to manage and resolve social misunderstandings or conflicts, often arising from "double empathy" issues.

## When to Use  
- Immediate (during conflict)

## How It Works (Mechanism)  
Reduces emotional arousal and prevents the "hijacking" of the amygdala. It uses cognitive strategies (perspective taking, pausing) to navigate social friction.

## Implementation Steps  
1. "I am feeling overwhelmed. Can we pause this discussion for 20 minutes?"  
2. "I think we might be misunderstanding each other. Here is what I heard..."  
3. Use "I" statements to express feelings without blame.

## Variations  
- Writing a letter/email to explain feelings after the fact.

## Effectiveness Evidence  
Moderate; supported by DBT and conflict resolution principles.

## Works Best For  
- Relationship maintenance  
- Misunderstandings  
- Emotional regulation

## May Not Work If  
- One party is abusive or unwilling to engage.
