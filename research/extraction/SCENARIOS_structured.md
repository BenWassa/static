# Scenario: Meltdown at Shopping Mall

## The Situation  
After 45 minutes of shopping in a crowded mall with fluorescent lighting and overlapping music/chatter, an adult freezes near the food court. When a companion asks, "What do you want for lunch?", the individual suddenly snaps, shouting "I don't know!" and covering their ears, or potentially engaging in self-injurious behavior like hitting their legs. This is not a tantrum to get their way; it is a total loss of behavioral control.

## What's Happening Neurologically  
The brain's thalamocortical gating system has failed to filter out redundant sensory input (lights, noise), causing the cortex to be flooded with data [1, 2]. This cumulative load triggers the sympathetic nervous system (SAM axis) into a mobilization response ("fight or flight"). The amygdala hijacks prefrontal cortical control, making logical decision-making impossible [3, 4].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- "Rumble stage": Pacing, repetitive questioning, or becoming unusually quiet before the explosion [5].  
- Physiological signs: Dilated pupils, rapid breathing, flushed skin (autonomic arousal) [6].  
- Irritability at minor demands (like choosing lunch).

# Scenario: Shutdown After Work Social Event

## The Situation  
After attending a mandatory two-hour networking mixer, an employee returns to their car and sits motionless for 40 minutes. They are physically unable to start the ignition or answer text messages. They feel "heavy," their vision may blur ("zoning out"), and they may lose the ability to speak (situational mutism) [8].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
The system has shifted from mobilization to immobilization, potentially activating the dorsal vagal complex (collapse/freeze response) [9]. This is a protective mechanism against the "monotropic split" caused by tracking multiple social conversations simultaneously. It may involve a mix of sympathetic tone (muscle tension) and parasympathetic braking (heart rate deceleration) [4, 10].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- "Glazed" look in the eyes or staring into space during the end of the event.  
- Monosyllabic responses ("Yes," "No") replacing full sentences.  
- Physical slumping or curling inward (fetal position) once private [11].

# Scenario: Masking Exhaustion Cycle

## The Situation  
A professional appears highly competent, social, and engaged from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. They make eye contact, use small talk, and attend meetings without issue. Upon arriving home, they immediately collapse into bed, unable to cook dinner, speak to their partner, or handle sensory input (like the TV) for the rest of the night. This cycle repeats daily until weekend burnout [13].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
The individual is using "compensatory" neural networks, specifically recruiting the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) and executive control systems to manually simulate social intuition [14, 15]. This high cognitive load depletes metabolic resources and keeps the HPA axis (cortisol) chronically activated, leading to "allostatic load" (wear and tear) that crashes once the external pressure is removed [16, 17].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- The "Cinderella Effect": Drastic difference between public and private functioning.  
- Increasing irritability or "short fuse" immediately upon entering a safe space.  
- High caffeine or sugar intake during the day to sustain the energy expenditure.

# Scenario: Missing Social Cues in Meeting

## The Situation  
During a team meeting, a manager says, "It would be great if someone could look into this file when they have time." The autistic employee interprets this as a general statement of fact or a wish, not a direct command. They do not volunteer. Later, they are reprimanded for "ignoring instructions" or "not being a team player" [19].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
This is a "Double Empathy" breakdown involving literal interpretation. The autistic brain prioritizes the explicit semantic content of language (bottom-up processing) over the implied pragmatic subtext (top-down inference) [20]. Social prediction errors are not automatically corrected because the brain does not intuitively map the indirect speech act to a social rule [21].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- The employee looks attentive and nods but does not take notes or action.  
- Confusion or surprise when the expectation is clarified later ("I didn't know you meant *me*").  
- A pattern of needing written follow-ups to verbal meetings.

# Scenario: Sensory Overload on Public Transit

## The Situation  
An individual is commuting on a bus. The sound of the engine, a baby crying, and the visual flicker of passing trees through the window feel distinct and equally loud/intense. They cannot filter the background noise to focus on a podcast. By the time they arrive at their destination, they are physically shaking, nauseous, and enraged [22].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
A failure of "habituation." While a neurotypical brain stops firing for repeated background noise (engine hum), the autistic brain continues to process it as novel and salient [3, 23]. This maintains the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system in a high-alert state, draining cognitive bandwidth before the day has even begun [2].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Wincing or flinching at specific sounds (brake squeals).  
- Covering eyes or wearing sunglasses indoors/on the bus.  
- Rapid breathing or checking the time obsessively (seeking escape).

# Scenario: Task Paralysis with Open-Ended Project

## The Situation  
An employee has a project due in two weeks with the instruction: "Create a marketing plan." They sit at their desk for six hours, staring at a blank screen, wanting desperately to start but feeling physically frozen. They may switch rapidly between tabs but produce nothing, leading to intense shame [24].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
This is "Autistic Inertia" combined with executive dysfunction. The open-ended nature of the task creates high "uncertainty," which consumes working memory. The "transition cost" to enter the task is too high because the steps aren't defined, leading to a bottleneck in the frontostriatal loops responsible for initiation [25, 26].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- "Pseudo-productivity": Cleaning the desk or organizing files instead of doing the main task.  
- Visible distress or "freezing" when asked for a status update.  
- Working late hours to compensate for the paralyzed daytime hours.

# Scenario: Alexithymia During Breakup

## The Situation  
During a difficult breakup conversation, the individual appears cold, logical, or indifferent. They discuss logistics (who keeps the apartment) calmly. Two days later, they wake up with chest pain, vomiting, and uncontrollable sobbing, confused about why they are suddenly "sick" [28].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
A decoupling between physiological arousal and conscious awareness (Alexithymia). The insula (body sensor) detects the distress, but the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) fails to integrate it into a conscious emotion label immediately [29, 30]. The emotion is processed as a physical symptom first, and the cognitive realization lags behind by days.

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- "Flat affect" or lack of expected emotional display during the crisis.  
- Complaints of physical symptoms (headache, stomach ache) instead of emotional words.  
- Intellectualizing the event ("It is logical that we separate").

# Scenario: Hyperfocus Time Loss

## The Situation  
An individual starts researching a specific topic (e.g., vintage cameras) at 8:00 PM. They blink and look at the clock, expecting it to be 9:00 PM, but it is 3:00 AM. They realize they have not eaten, used the bathroom, or moved for seven hours. Their body is stiff and they are dehydrated [25, 31].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
They have entered a "Monotropic flow state" or "attention tunnel." Dopaminergic reward pathways are highly engaged, suppressing interoceptive signals (hunger, thirst) and peripheral awareness [25]. Breaking this state feels physically painful or jarring.

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Irritability if interrupted ("snapping" at someone).  
- Neglect of biological needs (shaking from low blood sugar).  
- Intense energy and rapid speech ("infodumping") if asked about the topic.

# Scenario: Routine Disruption Distress

## The Situation  
An individual drives to their usual coffee shop on the way to work, but it is closed for renovations. They experience a surge of panic, unable to simply "go to the next one." They may drive home and call in sick, or have a meltdown in the car, feeling that the entire day is "ruined" [32].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
The autistic brain relies on rigid prediction models to manage environmental volatility. The closed shop is a massive "prediction error" (encoded with high precision) that destabilizes their mental map of the day [33, 34]. The cognitive effort required to recalculate the entire morning routine exceeds their available bandwidth.

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Extreme distress over seemingly "minor" changes.  
- Inability to make a Plan B immediately (cognitive rigidity).  
- Catastrophizing ("Everything is going wrong").

# Scenario: Communication Breakdown with Partner

## The Situation  
A partner asks, "Are you mad at me?" The autistic individual honestly answers "No." The partner gets upset, claiming the individual is "acting cold" and "silent." The autistic person becomes confused and defensive, leading to a fight. The autistic person was simply "offline" or neutral, not angry [20].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
The autistic individual may have a "flat affect" (lack of facial prosody) when relaxed or focused. They are missing the implicit social rule that silence requires "maintenance" (small talk/assurance) to signal safety to others. The partner misinterprets the lack of signal as a negative signal (hostility) [35].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Mismatch between words ("I'm fine") and tone/face (flat/unresponsive).  
- The autistic person asking "Why do you keep asking if I'm okay?"  
- Cyclic arguments about "attitude" or "tone."

scenario-interview-masking.md  
# Scenario: Job Interview Masking

## The Situation  
An applicant rehearses answers for days. During the interview, they force eye contact, smile at appropriate times, and suppress their natural urge to rock in the chair. They answer perfectly. Afterward, they sit in their car and tremble uncontrollably, unable to drive for an hour due to exhaustion [36].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
High-stakes camouflaging. The individual is using "algorithms" to run the social interaction, taxing working memory to its limit. The tremors are a release of the sympathetic nervous system tension (fight/flight) that was suppressed during the performance [37].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Performance may seem "too perfect" or slightly scripted/stiff.  
- Physical signs of strain (sweating, clenched hands) despite a calm voice.  
- Total collapse immediately after the event ends.

scenario-long-term-burnout.md  
# Scenario: Burnout Progression Over Months

## The Situation  
Over six months, a high-performing employee slowly loses the ability to keep up. First, they stop socializing. Then, they struggle to cook meals. Finally, they cannot read emails without panic. They feel they have "lost their skills" and intelligence. They are diagnosed with depression, but antidepressants don't help [38, 39].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
This is Autistic Burnout, caused by chronic allostatic overload. The cumulative cost of masking and sensory processing has exceeded the brain's recovery rate [40]. Neural networks enter a state of "functional loss" or regression to conserve energy for basic survival [41].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Loss of "activities of daily living" (showering, cleaning) despite going to work.  
- Increased sensory sensitivity (tolerance threshold drops) [38].  
- Regression in speech (more stuttering or silence) or motor skills.

scenario-delayed-processing.md  
# Scenario: Delayed Emotional Realization

## The Situation  
A coworker makes a rude comment. The autistic individual smiles and nods, continuing the work. Three days later, while doing dishes, they suddenly realize the comment was an insult and feel a surge of intense anger and humiliation [42].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
Processing speed differences and "monotropic split." During the interaction, cognitive resources were allocated to the "script" of being polite. The brain didn't have the bandwidth to decode the social subtext and process the emotion simultaneously. The realization occurs only when the brain is in a resting/safe state [29].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- A "frozen" smile during the initial interaction.  
- Bringing up "old" conflicts days or weeks later to resolve them.  
- Difficulty answering "How do you feel about that?" in the moment.

scenario-stimming-suppression.md  
# Scenario: Stimming Suppression at Work

## The Situation  
In a long meeting, an individual wants to flap their hands or rock to regulate their anxiety. Knowing this is "unprofessional," they sit on their hands and hold their body rigid. By the end of the meeting, they have a tension headache and cannot remember what was discussed [43, 44].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
Suppression of stimming is an active inhibitory process that consumes cognitive resources. Stimming provides vestibular/proprioceptive regulation; without it, the nervous system upregulates sympathetic arousal (anxiety). The effort to remain still diverts attention away from the auditory input (the meeting content) [45].

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Rigid posture or "white knuckling" the chair arms.  
- Subtle stims: Leg bouncing under the table, grinding teeth, or picking at cuticles.  
- Exhaustion post-meeting.

scenario-eye-contact-overwhelm.md  
# Scenario: Eye Contact Overwhelm During Conversation

## The Situation  
During a deep conversation, the autistic individual looks intently at the speaker's mouth or a spot over their shoulder. When forced to look in the eyes, they lose the thread of the conversation and feel a sensation of "burning" intensity or threat [1].

## What's Happening Neurologically  
The amygdala (threat detection) shows reduced habituation to faces, meaning eye contact remains a high-arousal "alarm" signal rather than fading into the background [46, 47]. Processing the visual intensity of the eyes competes with processing the verbal information (cognitive load bottleneck).

## Warning Signs Visible Here  
- Looking away whenever it is their turn to speak (reducing load to formulate words).  
- Physical flinching if the other person leans in for eye contact.  
- "Staring" that feels too intense (over-compensation) or completely averted gaze.
