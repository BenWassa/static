# Chapter Planning
## What Every Part 1 Chapter Needs to Do

Each chapter has one job: take a reader from **"I experience this"** to **"I understand why"** to **"I know what to do about it."**

That's the arc. Every element serves that movement.

---

## Proposed Chapter Template

**1. Opening scenario** — 2-3 sentences. No explanation yet. Just the experience, precisely described. Reader recognition before anything else.

**2. The simple truth** — 1-2 sentences maximum. Einstein-simple. What is actually happening. No jargon.

**3. The mechanism** — 3-4 paragraphs. Behavior → biology → implication. Concrete throughout. The "point, evidence, explanation" format we established early.

**4. Why it varies** — 1 paragraph. This isn't uniform. Some people experience X strongly, others barely at all. Prevents false universalism.

**5. What this connects to** — brief. How this system interacts with others covered in the guide. Cross-links. The nervous system doesn't operate in isolated channels.

**6. The cost** — 1 paragraph. What happens when this system is chronically stressed or ignored. Makes the stakes concrete without being alarmist.

**7. What actually helps** — not a strategy dump. 3-4 approaches, each with one sentence explaining the mechanism of why it works. Points to Part 3 for full detail.

## Now — Chapter by Chapter Plan

Six chapters in Part 1. Let's map what each one covers specifically.

---

### Chapter 1: Sensory Processing

**The core question:** Why does your nervous system receive the world at a different volume?

**Mechanisms to cover:**
- Thalamocortical gating (the filter that isn't working the same way)
- Habituation failure (why things don't fade into background)
- E/I imbalance — GABA/glutamate (the volume knob)
- Hyper vs hypo sensitivity (both ends of the same system)
- Multisensory integration (why multiple inputs compound)

**Behaviors to illustrate:**
- Auditory hypersensitivity (primary example)
- Visual overwhelm (secondary)
- Tactile defensiveness (tertiary)
- Touch as secondary example of hypo (sensory seeking)

**Opening scenario:** Restaurant. Multiple simultaneous inputs. What's flooding in.

**Key insight to land:** It's not sensitivity as weakness. It's a filtering difference. The signal is real. The gate is different.

**Connects to:** Capacity model (sensory load fills the cup fastest), Masking (suppressing sensory reactions costs energy)

---

### Chapter 2: Social Processing

**The core question:** Why does social interaction require conscious effort that seems automatic for everyone else?

**Mechanisms to cover:**
- Face processing (fusiform face area, repetition suppression)
- Theory of mind / social inference (mentalizing network)
- Double empathy problem (reframe: not a deficit, a difference)
- Processing speed bottleneck (real-time social demands)
- Implicit vs explicit rule learning

**Behaviors to illustrate:**
- Eye contact difficulty (primary — the amygdala alarm)
- Missing sarcasm/subtext (secondary — detail vs context processing)
- Missing implicit social rules (tertiary — explicit learning of automatic knowledge)
- Face blindness (brief — same network)

**Opening scenario:** Meeting. Someone says something. Three seconds later you realize you should have responded differently. The moment has passed.

**Key insight to land:** The double empathy problem. This is not a one-sided deficit. It's a communication difference between two different processing styles.

**Connects to:** Masking (social processing demands drive masking), Executive function (real-time processing bottleneck)

---

### Chapter 3: Executive Function

**The core question:** Why does starting, switching, planning, and finishing work differently?

**Mechanisms to cover:**
- Frontostriatal loops (initiation and switching)
- Monotropism (deep focus / transition cost)
- Working memory differences
- Time blindness (temporal processing)
- Cognitive flexibility vs rigidity
- Dopaminergic motivation system (interest-based vs demand-based)

**Behaviors to illustrate:**
- Task initiation paralysis (primary — autistic inertia)
- Difficulty with transitions (secondary — monotropic split)
- Time blindness (tertiary)
- Hyperfocus (the flip side — same system, different direction)

**Opening scenario:** You need to send one email. You have been aware of this for four hours. You have not sent the email.

**Key insight to land:** Hyperfocus and initiation paralysis are the same system. Monotropism cuts both ways. This is not laziness — it's a different motivational architecture.

**Connects to:** Capacity model (executive load depletes fastest under stress), ADHD differential (most overlap here)

---

### Chapter 4: Emotional Processing

**The core question:** Why is knowing what you feel — and when — different?

**Mechanisms to cover:**
- Interoception (the body's internal signal system)
- Insula ↔ ACC connectivity (where the disconnect happens)
- Alexithymia (labeling difficulty — 50% prevalence)
- Delayed emotional realization
- Emotional flooding (0 to 100)
- Meltdown physiology (sympathetic cascade)
- Shutdown physiology (dorsal vagal freeze)

**Behaviors to illustrate:**
- Alexithymia (primary — the decoupling)
- Delayed realization (secondary — the pet dying example)
- Emotional flooding (tertiary — the pen not working)
- Physical sensations misread as emotions

**Opening scenario:** Someone asks how you feel about something significant. You genuinely don't know. You're not deflecting. You check inside and find — nothing readable.

**Key insight to land:** Emotions are present. The signal pathway between body and awareness is different. This is interoception, not emotional absence.

**Connects to:** Meltdown/shutdown chapter (this chapter explains the fuel, that chapter explains the fire)

---

### Chapter 5: The Capacity Model

**The core question:** Why do small things cause big reactions?

**Mechanisms to cover:**
- Allostatic load theory
- The accumulation model (cup filling)
- Why autistic people's cups fill faster and drain slower
- The invisible nature of the load (others can't see it)
- Threshold and overflow (why the trigger is never the cause)
- Recovery physiology (what's actually depleted, what restores it)
- Burnout as sustained overflow (the long game)

**Behaviors to illustrate:**
- Meltdown over trivial trigger (primary — the sock seam)
- Post-event crash (secondary)
- Burnout progression (tertiary — months not minutes)
- The gap between how you look and how you are

**Opening scenario:** You are fine at 11am. By 3pm you are not fine. Nothing happened. Except everything happened, accumulated, invisibly.

**Key insight to land:** The trigger is never the cause. The cause is everything that came before. Understanding your load is the most practical skill in this guide.

**Connects to:** Every other chapter feeds into this one. The capacity model is the integrating framework.

**Interactive:** The Cup lives here.

---

### Chapter 6: Masking Mechanics

**The core question:** What are you actually doing when you perform neurotypical — and what does it cost?

**Mechanisms to cover:**
- What masking actually is (compensation vs suppression vs assimilation)
- Cognitive systems recruited (executive control, working memory, self-monitoring)
- vMPFC self-representation (the performance of a self)
- Cortisol and chronic stress (the physiological cost)
- Why masking fails under load (resources depleted)
- The identity cost (losing track of what's genuine)
- Gender and late diagnosis (why women/AFAB mask more effectively, get diagnosed later)

**Behaviors to illustrate:**
- Masking at work → collapsing at home (primary)
- Decades of masking → burnout in 30s/40s (secondary)
- Not knowing who you are without the mask (tertiary)
- Post-diagnosis unmasking difficulty

**Opening scenario:** You're good at this. You've been doing it for thirty years. Nobody knows. That's the problem.

**Key insight to land:** Masking isn't deception. It's survival adaptation. But it has a cost that compounds over time. And that cost is precisely measurable.

**Connects to:** Capacity model (masking is the single biggest cup-filler), Strategies (unmasking safely)

---

## What Each Chapter Is NOT

- Not a checklist of symptoms
- Not "do you relate to this?" validation
- Not a diagnosis tool
- Not exhaustive — covers the highest-impact mechanisms, not every edge case
- Not repetitive — each chapter adds new understanding, doesn't re-explain things covered elsewhere

---

## Cross-Chapter Architecture

Some concepts need to appear across multiple chapters without being re-explained. Solution: a consistent shorthand.

**The cup** — introduced in Chapter 5 but referenced briefly in every chapter as "this adds to load." Reader builds anticipation for the full model.

**The filter** — introduced in Chapter 1 (sensory). Referenced in Chapter 2 (social filter), Chapter 3 (cognitive filter). Same concept, different domains.

**The cost** — each chapter ends with what happens when this system is chronically stressed. Creates cumulative weight toward Chapter 5.
