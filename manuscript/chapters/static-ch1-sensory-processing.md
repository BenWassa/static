# Chapter 1: Sensory Processing
## Why the world arrives louder than it should

### Opening

You are sitting in a restaurant with someone you like. The food is good. There is no reason for this to be hard.

But the silverware hitting plates is registering at the same volume as the conversation. The refrigeration unit behind the bar has a hum that your brain has not filed away as irrelevant — it is still there, still full signal, every second. The overhead lights are not just bright; they are flickering at a frequency too fast to see consciously but not too fast for your visual cortex to keep processing. Across the room, someone laughs loudly. Your body registers it before your mind does.

You are not thinking about any of this. You are trying to have a conversation. But some part of your nervous system is fighting a four-front war simultaneously — managing the sound, the light, the temperature, the sensory fact of sitting in a chair in a public space — while the front of your brain tries to track what your companion just said.

By the time the bill arrives, you are exhausted in a way that has nothing to do with the food or the company. You have been sitting still for ninety minutes and you need to go home and lie down.

From the outside, nothing happened. From inside your nervous system, you just ran a marathon.

### The simple truth

Your brain receives sensory information differently — not more emotionally, not more anxiously, but more literally. The filtering system that decides what's relevant and what fades into background operates differently in your nervous system. More signal gets through. Less gets automatically dismissed.

This is a hardware difference, not a character one.

### How the filtering system works — and how yours is different

To understand what's happening, you need a brief picture of how sensory processing is supposed to work.

Your brain receives a constant flood of input — every sound, every light frequency, every tactile sensation, every smell in every room you occupy. If all of it reached your conscious awareness at full intensity, you would be unable to function within seconds. So the brain has systems designed to filter: to decide, automatically and below conscious awareness, what is important enough to register and what can be safely dimmed.

The primary gatekeeper in this system is the thalamus — a small structure deep in the brain that acts as a relay station between incoming sensory signals and the cortex, where conscious processing happens. The thalamus doesn't just pass signals along. It also inhibits them. Its job is to look at incoming data and make rapid decisions: this is new and important, send it up. This is repetitive background noise, dim it.

In many autistic brains, the coupling between the thalamus and the cortex works differently. The inhibitory function — the dimming — is less efficient. The gate is open wider. Instead of filtering the refrigerator hum into background, the thalamus forwards it upward at something close to full intensity. The cortex receives it. Registers it. Has to process it. Again and again.

This isn't a metaphor. Neuroimaging studies show altered thalamocortical connectivity in autistic adults — the circuitry that should be damping irrelevant signal is doing less damping.

### Why it doesn't fade

There's a second system that should be working alongside the thalamic gate: habituation.

Habituation is the brain's ability to learn that a stimulus is not important and stop responding to it. Neurotypical brains do this automatically and quickly. The air conditioning comes on. The brain registers it, determines it's not significant, and within seconds stops firing in response to it. It becomes inaudible not because it got quieter, but because the brain decided to ignore it.

In autistic brains, this adaptation happens more slowly, or less completely, or not at all for certain stimuli. The auditory cortex continues responding to repeated sounds as though they're new. The refrigerator hum doesn't fade. The flickering light doesn't become invisible. Each repetition continues to generate neural response.

The amygdala — the brain's threat-evaluation system — is also part of this. In neurotypical brains, the amygdala habituates quickly to non-threatening sensory input: it assesses, determines there's no danger, and stops raising the alarm. In many autistic brains, this habituation is slower. The amygdala maintains a low-level vigilance signal for longer. This isn't anxiety in the psychological sense — it's an automatic, physiological state of alertness that the conscious mind didn't choose and can't easily override.

The combined effect: the restaurant's background noise isn't just loud. It remains loud, continuously, for the entire duration of your time there. Your nervous system never gets the message that it's safe to stop tracking it.

### The chemistry underneath

The filtering and habituation systems run on a chemical balance between two neurotransmitters: glutamate, which is excitatory (it tells neurons to fire), and GABA, which is inhibitory (it tells neurons to stop firing).

The brain maintains a ratio between these two. When the ratio tips toward too much excitation and not enough inhibition, the neural environment becomes noisy — harder to organize, harder to filter, harder to quiet down. There is evidence that in autism, GABAergic inhibitory tone — the brain's suppression capacity — is reduced in sensory processing areas. The "stop firing" signal is weaker than it should be.

The result is a nervous system that is inherently more reactive and less able to turn down its own gain. More neurons firing means more signal reaching the cortex. More signal reaching the cortex means more of the world arriving at conscious awareness simultaneously.

This is why the restaurant is overwhelming not just when it's loud, but specifically when it's loud and bright and busy all at once. Each sensory channel is already running hotter than it should. When multiple channels fire simultaneously, they compete for the same limited processing bandwidth, and the system compounds — the total load is not the sum of its parts, it's larger.

### Why it varies

Not everyone experiences this the same way.

Some people have pronounced auditory sensitivity but manageable visual sensitivity. Some are primarily tactile — the feel of clothing is the primary daily management challenge, not noise. Some are hyposensitive in certain channels: instead of too much signal getting through, they receive too little, and seek intense input to feel adequately grounded.

The hyposensitive pattern — sensory seeking rather than sensory defending — comes from the same system in a different configuration. If the thalamic gate is open too wide in one direction, the person experiences flooding. If it's not generating enough signal, the body looks for more intense input to meet its threshold. This is why weighted blankets work: deep pressure activates the proprioceptive system, which in turn engages the parasympathetic nervous system — the brake. It's a manual way of achieving the inhibition the brain isn't generating automatically.

Some people switch between these states depending on their overall load — hypersensitive when depleted, and seeking intense input when under-stimulated. The direction changes. The underlying mechanism — an atypical E/I balance — is the same.

What all of this means practically: your sensory profile is your own. The specific channels, the specific triggers, the direction of the sensitivity — these vary considerably. What doesn't vary is the underlying reality that your nervous system is not filtering the world the same way most people's nervous systems do.

### What this costs

The most important thing to understand about sensory processing differences is what they cost over time — not in dramatic moments of overload, but in the daily arithmetic of ordinary environments.

An office with fluorescent lighting. A commute with unpredictable sounds. A grocery store at 5pm. None of these are emergencies. None of them will appear on any list of symptoms. But each one requires your nervous system to work harder than a neurotypical nervous system does in the same environment — not because you're trying harder, but because more of your processing resources are occupied managing incoming signal that the other person's brain has already automatically dismissed.

This is the extraneous load that fills the capacity cup. We'll return to this in Chapter 5 with the full model, but the principle applies here: sensory processing consumes a disproportionate amount of your total processing budget. Not when things go wrong — when things go entirely normally. A day of ordinary environments in which nothing bad happened has still cost you more than the same day would cost someone whose thalamic filter is fully operational.

This is part of why you're tired when you shouldn't be.

It's also what makes high-masking particularly expensive. If you've learned to suppress your sensory reactions — to not flinch at the siren, to not cover your ears, to maintain eye contact despite the visual intensity of someone's face — you are recruiting your prefrontal cortex to actively override your amygdala's alarm signals. That override is expensive. It burns through exactly the same cognitive resources you need for everything else. The suppression isn't free. It runs quietly in the background, drawing down the same account that thinking, communicating, and regulating yourself all draw from.

### What connects here

Sensory processing doesn't operate in isolation. The same filtering differences that flood your auditory cortex also affect how you process social signals — which is part of why social environments are particularly draining. The same E/I imbalance that affects sensory input affects emotional processing. The same habituation failures that keep the restaurant noise loud also affect how your nervous system learns to predict and adapt to new environments.

These connections will become clearer as the following chapters build the full picture. For now, the key anchors:

**Sensory load fills your capacity faster than most people's.** The cup metaphor in Chapter 5 begins here — ordinary environments cost more than they appear to.

**Masking sensory reactions is among the most expensive things you can do.** Suppressing the visible signs of sensory distress depletes the exact resources you need for everything else.

**Your sensory profile is individual.** The specific channels, directions, and intensities are yours. Understanding which specific inputs cost you the most is the first practical task in Part 2.

### What actually helps

The strategies live in Part 3. But the mechanisms matter here, briefly, because they explain why certain approaches work when others don't.

**Environmental modification works because it addresses the source.** Noise-canceling headphones don't train you to tolerate noise better — they reduce the signal reaching an already-overloaded system. Dimmer switches, natural light, removal of visual clutter: these reduce the volume of incoming data before it reaches the gate. If the gate is leaky, reducing what enters it is more effective than trying to fix the leak in the moment.

**Sensory breaks work because the system needs literal recovery time.** The nervous system isn't underperforming because it's weak — it's running at high capacity. Removing the input allows the accumulated activation to dissipate. Ten minutes in a quiet, dark room isn't a luxury — it's allowing an overloaded processing system to clear its buffer.

**Deep pressure and proprioceptive input work because they engage the inhibitory system directly.** They activate the parasympathetic nervous system — the same system that GABA is supposed to activate chemically. Weighted blankets, tight clothing, exercise: these are manual ways of generating the inhibitory signal the brain isn't automatically producing.

**What doesn't work:** Trying to habituate through repeated exposure without adequate recovery. Exposure to overwhelming environments without reducing the sensory load only trains the nervous system to anticipate threat. The goal is not desensitization — it's management.
