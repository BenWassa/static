# Chapter 5: The Capacity Model
## Why small things cause big reactions — and what's actually accumulating

---

### Opening

At 11am you are fine. You answer emails. You attend a meeting. You make small talk. You handle a phone call. You look fine. You feel fine, or at least functional.

By 3pm you drop a pen. It rolls under the desk. And suddenly you are filled with a rage or despair so disproportionate to the event that you cannot explain it to yourself, let alone to anyone watching. You want to scream, or you want to cry, or you want to leave the building immediately.

You think: why am I losing it over a pen?

The answer: you're not. You're losing it because between 11am and 3pm, something accumulated. The pen is just what was happening when the accumulation reached threshold. If it hadn't been the pen, it would have been the next thing — a slow webpage, a coworker's question, the feeling of your socks. The trigger is irrelevant. What matters is what filled the space before the trigger arrived.

### The simple truth

You have a daily capacity for processing demand — cognitive, sensory, social, emotional. This capacity is finite and depletes through use. For autistic adults, the capacity is often smaller to begin with, depletes faster during use, and restores more slowly during rest than the standard model assumes. Small things cause big reactions not because the small things are actually big, but because they arrive when capacity is already consumed. Understanding what fills the cup, how fast it fills, and what actually restores it is the most practical framework in this guide.

### The scientific model: allostatic load

The metaphor of the cup has a formal name in stress physiology: allostatic load.

Allostasis is the process of achieving stability through change — the body adapting to stress by activating various systems. The cardiovascular system adjusts. The HPA axis releases cortisol. The nervous system shifts into higher alert states. This is normal and necessary.

Allostatic load is what accumulates when these adaptive systems run continuously without adequate recovery time. The wear and tear of constant adaptation. The cost of sustained activation.

For autistic adults, the relevant insight is that ordinary environments — not dramatic ones, ordinary ones — require more continuous adaptation than they do for most people. The sensory environment requires active management. The social environment requires conscious performance. Task transitions require effortful recalibration. This means the allostatic load accumulates faster from lower-intensity inputs.

The model has two coupled components: fast fatigue and slow accumulation.

Fast fatigue is measured in hours. It's the acute depletion of working memory, sensory tolerance, and emotional regulation capacity within a single day. This is what fills during a typical workday and empties during a typical evening of rest — if the evening actually provides rest.

Slow accumulation is measured in weeks and months. It's the long-term physiological debt that builds when fast fatigue is never fully resolved — when the daily cup overflows repeatedly, when recovery is incomplete, when the baseline capacity starts shrinking. This is burnout.

Both matter. Both need to be tracked. But they operate on different timescales and require different interventions.

### Why your cup fills faster

Three primary drivers fill the cup faster for autistic adults than the standard model predicts.

**Sensory processing load.** Chapter 1 covered why: the thalamocortical gate is leaky, habituation fails, background inputs remain at full signal. The practical result is that your sensory environment continuously consumes processing bandwidth. The hum of the lights, the texture of clothing, the ambient noise of an office — these aren't neutral. They're ongoing withdrawals from the same resource pool that thinking, planning, and regulating yourself all draw from.

**Cognitive switching costs.** Chapter 3 covered the mechanism: monotropic attention architecture makes transitions between states expensive. Every interruption, every task switch, every shift from one type of demand to another incurs a cost. A day with ten small interruptions is not ten small things. It's ten high-cost transitions, each depleting capacity.

**Masking effort.** Chapter 6 will cover this in depth, but the principle applies here: if you are performing neurotypical — suppressing sensory reactions, forcing eye contact, scripting social responses, inhibiting stims — you are recruiting executive resources continuously in the background. Even during activities that should be relaxing, the mask runs and the meter runs with it.

These three are not additive — they're multiplicative. A noisy environment while masking during frequent task switches isn't the sum of three separate costs. It's a compound load where each factor amplifies the others.

### Why your cup drains slower

Capacity restoration is not instantaneous. It has a speed limit, and for many autistic adults that speed limit is lower than average.

**Nervous system recovery.** The parasympathetic nervous system — the brake that calms you down after stress — engages more slowly and less effectively in many autistic adults. Heart rate variability, a marker of parasympathetic function, is consistently lower on average. This means the physiological activation that builds during a stressful day takes longer to dissipate, and may not fully resolve overnight.

**Sleep efficiency.** Autistic adults consistently show longer sleep latency (time to fall asleep), more frequent waking, and lower overall sleep efficiency. The nightly reset that should restore capacity is often incomplete. You wake already behind.

**Residual load from prior days.** If yesterday's cup didn't fully empty before today started, today begins with less capacity than baseline. If this pattern repeats — and for most autistic adults in standard environments it does — the residual accumulates. Each day starts a little more depleted than the last until something forces a reset.

The asymmetry is the problem. The cup fills quickly from many sources. It drains slowly from fewer. The math doesn't balance.

### Threshold and overflow

Overflow occurs when the current load exceeds available capacity. This is not the same threshold every day.

If you slept poorly, the threshold is lower. If you're recovering from previous overflow, the threshold is lower. If you're fighting off illness, managing chronic pain, dealing with a life stressor — all of these reduce the threshold. The same day that was manageable last week may not be manageable this week, not because your capacity changed permanently but because your threshold shifted.

The trigger — the pen, the sock seam, the minor frustration — is whatever was happening when load crossed threshold. It is not the cause. It is the marker. Focusing on the trigger is missing the mechanism.

**Meltdown is one overflow pattern.** The sympathetic nervous system floods the body with activation. Fight-or-flight engaged by overwhelm rather than actual threat. Outward explosion — crying, shouting, aggression, self-injury — as the system attempts to discharge excess activation. Prefrontal cortex offline. Amygdala driving. Not a choice. Not controllable through willpower once started.

**Shutdown is the other.** Parasympathetic dominance. Freeze rather than fight. Motor inhibition. Speech may become impossible. Movement difficult. Appears calm from outside. Internally locked. Not rest — a protective state where the system forcibly reduces input to prevent further damage.

Both are involuntary. Both require actual recovery time, not just willpower or a pep talk.

### The gap between how you look and how you are

High-masking autistic adults often maintain behavioral performance even while physiological stress markers are at critical levels. Hair cortisol — a measure of chronic stress over months — is elevated. Heart rate variability is depressed. Sleep is disrupted. But the outward presentation remains controlled, functional, apparently fine.

This creates a specific problem: the people around you, and sometimes you yourself, calibrate expectations based on the visible performance rather than the invisible cost. You appear to handle it, so the assumption is that handling it is not expensive. The collapse, when it comes, seems sudden — but it was building the entire time, just not visibly.

This is why "you seemed fine" is such a common phrase in the aftermath. You did seem fine. You were performing fine. The performance was consuming everything you had.

### Hysteresis: why recovery takes longer than depletion

After an overflow event, capacity doesn't simply return to baseline. There is hysteresis — a kind of inertia in the system. The threshold drops. The next day it takes less to trigger another overflow. Recovery time is longer than depletion time, which means that repeated overflow creates a downward spiral where each event makes the next one more likely.

This is why two hard days back-to-back are not twice as hard as one hard day — they're significantly more than twice as hard, because the second day starts from a reduced baseline and takes longer to recover from.

The practical implication: recovery needs to be longer and more complete than the depletion period. One evening of quiet after a demanding day may not be enough. One weekend after a demanding week may not be enough. The math is asymmetric.

### Burnout: sustained overflow

When fast fatigue repeatedly overflows without adequate recovery for weeks or months, the system enters chronic overload. This is autistic burnout — not the metaphorical kind where you need a vacation, but a physiological state where baseline capacity has shrunk, threshold is chronically lowered, and skills that were previously accessible become unavailable.

Executive function degrades first — planning, initiation, organization. Then more automatic skills: cooking, showering, responding to messages. In severe burnout, even basic self-care can become difficult. Masking becomes impossible. Sensory sensitivity increases. Meltdowns and shutdowns become more frequent.

This is not depression, though they can co-occur. Depression is a mood and motivation disorder. Burnout is a capacity disorder. The mechanism is HPA axis dysregulation and the long-term effects of sustained allostatic overload.

Recovery from burnout is measured in months, not days. It requires sustained reduction in load, which often means significant life changes — reduced work hours, environmental modifications, reduced social demands. Pushing through makes it worse.

### The math of an ordinary day

Understanding why you're tired when nothing dramatic happened requires looking at the actual load calculation.

Take a one-hour meeting as an example.

**Neurotypical load:** Cognitive demand of the meeting itself. Maybe 10 units of capacity.

**Autistic load:** 
- Cognitive demand: 10 units
- Sensory processing (fluorescent lights, HVAC noise, people moving): 15 units
- Social processing (reading faces, tracking implied meaning, scripting responses): 25 units
- Masking (suppressing stims, forcing eye contact, managing tone): 20 units
- Transition cost (stopping previous task, starting this one): 10 units
- **Total: 80 units**

A standard workday might include five such meetings, plus email, plus task work, plus lunch in a noisy cafeteria, plus the commute. The math is not forgiving.

By 3pm the cup is full. The pen is irrelevant.

### Why it varies

Baseline capacity varies significantly across individuals. Some people have larger cups to begin with. Some drain faster. Some restore more efficiently.

The specific triggers that fill the cup fastest also vary. For some it's primarily sensory. For others it's social or executive demands. Some people handle predictable high-load days well but collapse under unpredictable low-load ones. Some are the reverse.

The threshold for overflow also varies, both across people and across time for the same person. Hormonal cycles affect it. Sleep affects it. Physical health affects it. Medication affects it. What worked last month may not work this month.

The model remains consistent — capacity, load, threshold, overflow, recovery — but the specific numbers and patterns are individual.

### What actually helps

The strategies are in Part 3, but the model points directly to what categories of intervention are possible.

**Reduce input load.** Environmental modification to reduce sensory demands. Communication strategies to reduce social processing cost. Task batching to reduce switching. These lower the rate at which the cup fills.

**Increase drain rate.** Sensory rest. Unmasking time. Sleep hygiene. Activities that genuinely restore rather than deplete. These increase the rate at which capacity restores.

**Manage threshold.** Recognizing early warning signs before overflow. Building in buffer time. Pacing across days and weeks rather than optimizing single days. These reduce the frequency of crossing threshold.

**Prevent residual accumulation.** Ensuring recovery is complete before the next high-load period. Building in margin. Accepting that rest is not optional — it's the thing that makes continued function possible.

The model is not theoretical. It's a practical tool. Track what fills your cup. Track what drains it. Track the patterns that precede overflow. The data is there. Most people have never been taught to look for it.
